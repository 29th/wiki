Soldiers are not to advertise the 29th ID in game servers or web sites
that do not belong to the 29th ID, without the permission of the game
servers' or web sites' administrators. This mainly pertains to
recruiting in another unit/clan's server or forum, but applies to any
game server or web site where recruiting is against their rules.

Recruiting should take place in our servers, our web site, and other
gaming web sites that allow recruiting. If a player/user in another game
server or web site inquires about joining the 29th ID, the soldier
should contact that player/user via SteamFriends or Private Message and
provide the information in private. Alternatively, the soldier can ask a
present admin if providing information to the inquiring player/user is
allowed.
