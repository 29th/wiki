1.  REDIRECT [Battalion Support
    Staff](Battalion_Support_Staff "wikilink")

A lot of things happen in the 29th, and it requires a lot of work. This
work does not get done by just one person, or even a few. Many 29ers
have a staff position in the unit, ranging from clerical work to the
Drill Instructors who taught you to be a 29er. These jobs are open to
you, too, and we encourage you to [lend a
hand](Get_a_Job_in_the_Unit "wikilink").

You may see all of the staff positions and the people that occupy them
[here](http://29th.org/personnel/staff/) or by using this drop down on
the forum:

ranking" than **2**. This list reflects our current structure:
