  - What are the reserves?

<!-- end list -->

  -   
    The Reserves are a platoon set aside from the companies that exists
    to allow 29th members who cannot attend regular drills to remain in
    the 29th. Members of the reserve platoon cannot commit to drill
    times but show their commitment in other ways.

<!-- end list -->

  - What commitments are those?

<!-- end list -->

  -   
    It could be anything from running events through the Operations
    Office, to creating and editing maps with the Engineer office, or
    even simply recruiting. The ways that someone can contribute to the
    29th are almost innumerable; new ways to show commitment are
    routinely being created.

<!-- end list -->

  - Who qualifies for the Reserves?

<!-- end list -->

  -   
    I'm certain many of you have seen one of your squad members (or have
    personal experience) where that person can no longer commit to
    making the 29th drill schedule and no transfer to another squad is
    possible. Most of the time that leads to an Honorable Discharge. The
    new Reserves hopes to solve this. Any 29th member who has at least
    three months of service and who occupies an essential position may
    apply for a position in the Reserves.

<!-- end list -->

  - Can retired members join the reserves?

<!-- end list -->

  -   
    Yes, former members may reenlist for a reserve position.

<!-- end list -->

  - What about rank/AIT/attending 29th events? What are the benefits of
    the Reserves?'''

<!-- end list -->

  -   
    A complex question with a moderately complex answer. The main
    benefit of joining the Reserves is the ability to continue your
    progression in the 29th without the need for a discharge.

:; Rank

  - 
    
      -   
        Reserves are a support platoon. As such, there will be no
        leadership positions available. Essentially, all reservists will
        be enlisted men and technicians. As a Pvt or a PFC, nothing
        changes for you. As an NCO, that means converting to the nearest
        technician rank. On the other hand, this creates new
        opportunities for everyone to work their way up the ranks of the
        29th through the technician system. Reservists will qualify for
        promotion up to a maximum T/3 through their contributions to the
        unit.

:; AIT

  - 
    
      -   
        Weapons restrictions will still apply and will be based on rank.
        Reservists will still be able to be in AIT and earn checkmarks.
        Reservists will work with the Chief Reservist to work out
        training methods for the AIT and game in quest\[u\]ion.

:; 29th Events

  - 
    
      -   
        Reservists can attend and participate in any and all 29th events
        (including drills, Operation Events, and OC\[b\]S scrims).

  - I am one of the people who may need to discharge but I would rather
    join the Reserves, how do I sign up?'''

<!-- end list -->

  -   
    Contact your Squad Leader with the details\!

<!-- end list -->

  - Can you transfer back to your old squad after being in reserves?'''

<!-- end list -->

  -   
    Yes, once you can make drill times you can ask to be transferred
    back to active duty. Rank/position will be decided by the
    Company/Platoon/Squad you transfer to.
