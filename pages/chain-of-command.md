Also known as "CoC", the chain of command essentially means that if you
have any requests, questions, problems or concerns you should [Contact
Your Squad Leader](Contact_Your_Squad_Leader "wikilink") first.

Outside of the squad hierarchy, the Squad Leaders move paperwork up to
the platoon Sergeant who would bring it to the platoon Leader. From the
platoon level the Platoon Sergeant will take issues he has to the
Company Sergeant and the Platoon leader will take issues he has to the
Company Commander.

Everything, both positive and negative, moves from the bottom up and
from the top down. It is important that avoid skipping steps in the
chain of command when ever your issue can be dealt with by your
immediate superior.
