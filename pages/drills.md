As a member of the 29th you are asked to attend 3 drills a week,
Company, Platoon and Squad. Each Leadership level works hard to plan and
run an informative and entertaining drill each week.

## Squad Drill

Squad drills are the backbone of our training regime. Each week the
squads will work on the base components of infantry tactics. These topic
can include but are not limited to:

  - Movement Formations
  - Land Navigation (Orientation)
  - Suppression fire
  - Breech and Clear (Building Clearing)
  - CQC (Close Quarter Combat)
  - Weapon Familiarization
  - etc.

## Platoon Drill

Platoon drills bring all squads of a platoon together to implement SOP
and practice fighting tactics which are being worked on by the
individual squads. Platoon HQ uses the Platoon Drills to asses the
progress of the squads and their ability to work together to achieve
goals.

## Company Drill

The Company Drill is where all Platoons in a Company come together to
practice and fight as one. Company drills are grand scale fights which
usually fill a server.
