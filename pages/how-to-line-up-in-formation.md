Platoon formation is the standard method of lining up when a platoon is
present, whether it be at [Drills](Drills "wikilink") or an organised
scrimmage. You will be practising this weekly at drills and it is best
to understand the formation in order to line up in your place as quickly
as possible.

Below, you will see a diagram of your typical Platoon Formation.

**Legend**

  - SLs - Squad Leaders
  - ASLs - Assistant Squad Leaders

Between the SL and ASL, the squad is lined up in rank order, just as you
are used to, with PFCs closer to the SL and Privates on the other end.
It may seem unusual to have a higher-ranking member (the ASL) on the
end, but that is how this formation works.
