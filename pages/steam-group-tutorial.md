# Steam Group Responsibilities for Platoon Clerks

  - Schedule weekly events for Platoon Drills and Company Drills
  - Remove members who are discharged or transferred out of your platoon
  - Invite members who are assigned to your platoon

It is recommended to do this in your normal browser rather than the
Steam Community browser, as the Steam browser can be a bit slow. Use
[these URLs](Steam_Groups "wikilink") to find the groups.

## Creating Events

To create an event in a Steam Community group, browse to the group's
profile page. If you are logged in, you will see an 'Actions' panel on
the right-hand side. Click on 'Schedule an event'. On this page you will
see a form. Please use the following methods for filling it out.

1.  Event Name: Should always be simply 'Platoon Drills' or 'Company
    Drills'
2.  Event Type: Play a Game (Selecting this will create several fields
    below it)
3.  Game: Darkest Hour
4.  Game Server IP: The server IP where the drill is to be held,
    including the port
5.  Server Password: The password being used at the drill
6.  Description: Leave blank unless directed otherwise
7.  Start time: Five minutes before the drill starts for you. Steam
    knows your timezone, so enter when the drill starts your time - it
    will adjust for other members automatically. Remember to put it 5
    minutes before the drill, so that members get the event reminder 5
    minutes ahead of time.

Then click 'Save' and you're done. For a reference, see the below
screenshot example of a properly filled out event for BP1. Note that
while BP1 drills take place on Mondays at 9pm EST, I scheduled it for
Tuesday at 2am since I am on GMT time.

Note that there are plenty of FireFox extensions out there (i.e.
autofill) that can make this process much quicker. If you find an
easy/quick way of doing this, be sure to tell your fellow platoon clerks
to help them out\!

## Removing Members

Any member who is discharged from the unit or transferred out of your
platoon should be removed from the platoon's Steam group. The best way
to keep track of this is to monitor the 'News Feed' on your platoon's
'Stats' page and look for Discharge/Transfer feeds. Alternatively, you
can simply work off of your platoon's roster and confirm it with the
Steam Group roster.

1.  Browse to your platoon's Steam group
2.  If you are logged in, you will see an 'Actions' panel on the right.
    Click 'Admin Options' and then 'Manage group members' in the
    drop-down
3.  Find the member you wish to remove, then simply click the 'X' next
    to their name

Note: To ensure you are removing the right Steam member, find their
steam profile name by going to their personnel file and clicking the
Steam icon at the bottom-left of it. To find their personnel file, click
their name on their discharge papers or in the news feed.

## Inviting Members

All members who are assigned to your platoon, whether by graduating BCT
or by being transferred in, should be invited to the platoon's Steam
group. To do this, you do not need to be 'friends' with them on Steam.
Simply find their Steam profile page and click on 'Invite to join your
group' on the right-hand side of the page, and select your platoon's
group.

Note: To ensure you are inviting the right Steam member, find their
steam profile page by going to their personnel file and clicking the
Steam icon at the bottom-left of it. To find their personnel file, click
their name on the roster, or the graduation thread, or search their name
in the member search at the top-right of the forums.
