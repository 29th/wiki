If a soldier recruits a cadet but the cadet does not list the soldier as
their recruiter, the soldier should use the [Claim Your
Recruit](http://forums.29th.org/discussion/104/claim-your-recruit)
thread to receive credit. In doing so, the soldier will have that
recruit reflected on their recruitment record.
