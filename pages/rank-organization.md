In the 29th ID, an assignment is a role, position or job someone has been assigned to fulfill. There is a wide variety of assignments in the unit, most of them voluntary in some regard but everyone in the unit has at least one. Assignments can be divided into two classes, Combat and Staff, which themselves can be broken down in a larger number of sub-categories. Sometimes referred to as roles, jobs, or billets, every assignment has an important function within the unit and allows it to run effectively and efficiently.

Assignments are part of the chain-of-command and unit structure of the 29th. How much authority one has in a given situation is a combination of one's rank and assignment. In many cases, the assignment of all present will be the major factor in determining who is in charge at any point in time. A quick glance at the roster at any point in time will reveal a large degree of variance in the types of people in various assignments, as much of the time roles are filled based on the needs of the company at the time the need occurs.

**Combat Assignments**

For more information see Unit Structure

At its heart, the 29th is a realism unit that regularly plays games in a more realistic fashion. This means that playing the game is at the core of one's experience in the 29th and therefore, almost everyone in the unit has at least one combat assignment. They represent the soldier's primary role in-game and where their expertise lies. While staff assignments are almost completely voluntary, combat assignments are usually not in the sense that, with very rare exceptions, one must have a combat assignment of some sort. Members solely dedicated to staff work are very rare.

It should be noted that the term "combat" in this context also refers to someone's position with a squad, platoon, company or battalion and is not restricted solely on in-game activity. There are many facets to being in any of these units and many of these positions involve supporting the unit's in-game activities in some way.

**Squad Level Assignments**

For more information see AITs (Squad), AITs (RS2), AITs (Arma 3)

Advanced Individual Training (AIT) - This refers to any of the basic combat roles found at the squad level and includes Rifleman, Machine Gunner, Combat engineer, etc. If any combat role could be seen as the "default" combat assignment this is it, and specifically, the Rifleman AIT. Everyone who joins the unit and graduates BCT will be placed in a squad with AIT assignment, most commonly starting with Rifleman with the possibility of moving onto another AIT down the road. Overall, those fulfilling this role are the boots on the ground in any combat scenario, carrying out their orders to the best of their ability and completing the objectives assigned to their squad.

Assistant Squad Leader (ASL) - Junior leadership assigned to assist a more experienced squad leader in leading a small, dedicated roster of 9-12 soldiers. ASLs are often junior NCOs or PFCs who have yet to pass Squad Leadership Training. This assignment is an important step in one's progression in the unit as it is the first role that grants true authority and responsibility. It is also the first assignment that grants members unrestricted access to all weapons (with the exception of the sniper). ASLs are expected to immediately take over the squad in any regard should their superior be unable to continue leading.

Squad Leader (SL) - The squad is the most basic unit in the 29th and Squad Leader is its leader. SLs are expected to be responsible for their squad's discipline, training, skill, morale, and any related paperwork. They are also the first step in solving problems experienced by those under the charge, whether they be personal or technical in nature. Squad Leadership is one of the most important aspects of the 29th as it often has a profound impact on not only the soldiers who make up the squad, but the person leading the squad as well, given how much more personal the role is compared to leadership roles higher up the chain-of-command.

**Platoon Level Assignments**

Platoon Clerk - A voluntary position chosen for their reliability and professionalism, these soldiers are responsible for completing much of the platoon-level paperwork and most importantly, doing it quickly and correctly. This can include posting awards, writing after-action reports, and ensuring drills are scheduled on the calendar. Platoon Clerks are also often tasked with keeping platoon leadership update on what paperwork-related tasks need to be done. This role can potentially lead to the position of company clerk and is a good choice for someone who wishes to progress and contribute to the unit but would prefer to not enter the demanding roles of combat leadership. This position does not, in and of itself, grant command authority except in relation to their specific duties. However, they are expected to have a high level of professionalism and motivation which often sees them taking leadership of small groups in combat.

Platoon Sniper - The Sniper AIT tends to be restricted to one per platoon, not squad, due to the restricted nature of the weapon kit in events of all types. Because of this, snipers are picked very carefully and are considered a platoon asset, helping platoon leadership get a sense of the situation, scout out the surrounding area, find important targets and if possible, eliminate those targets. This position does not, in and of itself, grant command authority. However, they are expected to have a high level of professionalism and motivation which often sees them taking leadership of small groups in combat.

Platoon Sergeant (PSgt) - Assists the Platoon Leader in running a platoon, ensuring their orders are carried out and are often directly responsible for the discipline, training and frontline leadership during combat. They also act as the first line of dicipline for more serious offenses and breaches of protocol. Because they often have multi-year, practical experience in the unit, platoon sergeants and often act as mentors to both the enlisted members below and the junior officers above. Additionally, since most official events in the 29th involve the deployment of a platoon, the platoon sergeant is critical to the success of the unit in its most important endeavors.

Platoon Leader (PL) - Very often the first assignment for a newly-commissioned officer, Platoon Leaders determine the direction of the platoon, decide what needs to be done, lead their platoon in combat operations and often handle much of the platoon's important paperwork. Platoon Leaders work closely with their platoon sergeant, learning from the latter's experience and learning the ropes of platoon-level leadership. Since the unit tends to deploy platoons in official events, the Platoon Leader is tasked with drawing the battle plan and executing it properly to ensure victory. This is also the first individual that most members will salute on a regular basis.

**Company Level Assignments**

Company Clerk - Those in this position are charged with handling company-level paperwork as well as completing additional tasks as required by company leadership. Although there are some parallel's with the platoon counterpart, it is common to see company clerks take on a more mentoring role for the clerks below them. They often ensure that the platoon clerks are doing their jobs properly and on time and also make recommendations regarding this aspect to all levels of the company. Much like the platoon clerk, this assignment does not grant authority in and of itself, but often find themselves in small leadership capacities due to the amount of experience they tend to accumulate by the time they reach this position.

Senior NCO (SNCO) - The top ranking NCO in a company, those holding this position assist the Company Commander and (if present) Executive Officer in running the company. Primarily responsible for the training and discipline of those under their command, SNCOs are often some of the most capable, versatile and driven leaders in the company and have vast knowledge of both the game the company is deployed in as well the soldiers found under the command. They also handle the majority of more serious disciplinary issues that occur within the company, which requires them to be stern and harsh at times. This assignment is also unique in that it can only be held by a First Sergeant.

Executive Officer (XO) - Similar to Company Sergeant, the Executive Officer is an optional role in the company headquarters. It is often assigned to a capable junior officer who has proven to be capable and dependable and tasked with assisting the Commanding Officer in their duties relating to policy setting, company-level paperwork, and even public relations with non-29th communities.

Commanding Officer (CO) - The absolute leader of the company. Commanding Officers determine company-related policy and the direct the company takes in the long term, particularly in relation to how the company functions both within the whole of the 29th as well the game's whole community. COs also act as the public face of the company, interacting with leadership from other units and arranging events when the opportunity arises, essentially functioning as diplomats for the unit. Company COs are usually quite capable combat leaders due to their experience but often do not serve in this capacity very often due taking on more administrative duties at this point.

**Battalion Level Assignments**

Battalion Clerk - Handles a variety of important paperwork tasks that, unsurprisingly, affects the entire Battalion. This ranges from important awards to assigning of recruits fresh out of BCT and can also be of a more technical nature. This position is the pinnacle of 29th clerking and those who hold have years of extensive experience and knowledge of 29th rules, policy, and procedures.

Battalion Executive Officer -

Battalion Commander - Currently assumes command of the entire 29th ID. Being that the unit currently operates as a Battalion, the Battalion CO has the final say in all matters of the unit. Since the Companies and Platoons can usually handle their own affairs, this individual tends to only step in when it is most important or when the issue at hand affects the entirety of the unit. The Battalion CO is crucial both in setting the rule and the example and helps to tie all companies together under the single banner of the 29th ID.

_For more information see Staff Offices_

In addition to every member's primary combat assignment, there are many staff-related assignments (sometimes referred to as "staff jobs") that members can volunteer to fulfil. The assignments are found within Staff Offices, organized units that serve a specific function outside of in game combat. Each office a variety of different jobs that need to be done and many have room for advancement in themselves. Staff assignments allow members to get more involved in the unit, learn its various parts, get their name out there for future considerations, and allow one to donate their time to keep the 29th functioning. Many of the 29th's greatest leaders have been involved in some sort of staff assignment and many do so throughout their time in the unit.

Each staff office has their own Chain-of-command that is separate from the primary three companies and is important to follow as any standard company CoC. There are often opportunities for advancement within the offices themselves, allowing one to get unique but valuable leadership experience outside of combat. Those who perform exceptionally well can be awarded medals and on the rare occasion, promotions.
