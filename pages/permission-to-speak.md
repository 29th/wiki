drill leader/team leader. To do this, simply type **PTS** in chat and
your request may or may not be granted when the speaker is finished
talking.

Leader** will reply in **All Chat**  
(Only team leaders should PTS the drill leader)

PTS going to the **Team Leader** will be in **Team Chat**, the **Team
Leader** will reply in **Team Chat**
