Spawn Camping is not allowed in 29th Infantry Division servers, and is
defined as the following

  - Attacking soldiers that are defenseless due to spawning or
    teleporting
  - Camping any location that is the only way the opposing team can move
    out of their spawn area
  - Distance from target is not an excuse for long distance weapons like
    tanks, mortars, and artillery
