There is to be no whining and moaning in the server about things such as
the map, players camping, [Spawn Camping](Spawn_Camping "wikilink"),
being "cheap", proning, etc.

If someone is legitimately breaking the server rules, instead of
whining:

1.  Inform them of the rules and that they are violating them
2.  Tell an admin, who will warn them, then kick them

Apart from that, if someone is doing something you do not like, either
keep it to yourself or politely ask them to stop. This makes the server
a more enjoyable environment and keeps gameplay friendly. See referenced
announcement below for details of how this came about
