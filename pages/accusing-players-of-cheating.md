Soldiers who suspect other players (public or 29th members) of
cheating/hacking are not to publicly accuse them. Instead, they should
report this to a [Military Police Officer or a Server
Admin](Military_Police_Corps "wikilink"), preferably via the reporting
Soldier's [Squad Leader](Contact_Your_Squad_Leader "wikilink") if they
are online.
