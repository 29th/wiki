(1) Soldiers are not to question admin disciplinary actions publicly. If
a soldier sees a higher-ranking admin kick or ban someone, that soldier
should not publicly question the admin's reasoning.

(2) Sometimes [Military Police](Military_Police_Corps "wikilink") will
be on the server playing under a public players name in order to catch
hackers. If you recognise one, do not reveal their identity.

If a soldier has a question or problem about an admin's reasoning, the
soldier should contact the admin in private, via SteamFriends, IM, or
Forum PM.

If you suspect an admin is abusing their power, you can [report it to
your Squad Leader](Contact_Your_Squad_Leader "wikilink") who will know
how to take it up the Chain of Command to the appropriate authority
