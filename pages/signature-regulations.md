This refers to forum signatures, which are automatically included at the
bottom of forum posts.

If a soldier wishes to have content in the signature field, it may
include no more than two images, and be no more than 200 characters.
Text formatting and quote boxes are acceptable. All content should keep
the forum rules in mind, which prohibit offensive remarks and images.
