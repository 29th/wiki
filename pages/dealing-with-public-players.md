Your actions towards public players in our server and on our forums
reflects the actions of all 29th members, and can define their opinion
of the 29th as a whole. Use courtesy and have patience when dealing with
'pubbers.'

  - Public players are expected to follow our [Server
    Rules](http://29th.org/about/server/)
  - All 29th members are expected to help enforce our rules when they
    are the highest rank present and no one else is already dealing with
    the problem.
  - If you want a public player to do something, always ask with the
    word "please". At least the first time.
  - Do not get in to arguments with public players, even if you are
    correct you will look foolish.
  - Do not threaten public players. If you do not have admin you will
    look foolish if you cannot follow through.
  - If a public player will not follow our rules [get in contact with a
    MP](Military_Police_Corps "wikilink") or someone with admin powers.
  - Never publicly comment on any admin usage you observe in game.
  - Never accuse a player of cheating or hacking in public, if you
    seriously suspect someone of this, get in contact with a MP.
  - If a MP, or any other 29th member is addressing a public player
    about rules, do not join in and "Gang up" on them.
  - If a senior rank begins to talk to a public player when you trying
    to enforce rules, your job is finished. Steam message the Senior
    rank if you need to provide information.
  - Be polite when recruiting. Do not spam comms, do not discuss any
    private details and try to get a steam message to your potential
    recruit.
  - As a 29th member, you will be expected to act in a certain manner.
    Do not allow frustration or anger make you lower yourself.
  - When asking public players to leave a private server, refer them to
    our public server or let them know when they can return. You could
    even suggest they enlist so they don't *have to* leave in the
    future.
