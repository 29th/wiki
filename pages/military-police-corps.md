The Military Police Corps is a Staff Office within [S-2
Intelligence](S-2_Intelligence "wikilink") that is responsible for
ensuring that the rules of the 29th Infantry Division are enforced, both
on the servers and generally in the 29th. The office consists of several
Military Police Officers (MPs) and Server Admins. Their primary
functions include:

  - Monitoring game servers, forums, and teamspeak for rule violations
    (by public players and 29th members alike)
  - Ensuring players deemed a security risk do not have access to 29th
    areas
  - Arbitrating the majority of ban disputes

## How to Contact an MP or Server Admin

  - Send an email to mp@29th.org - This will be forwarded to all
    existing MPs
  - View the [Military Police Corps Staff
    List](http://personnel.29th.org/#units/MP) to PM an MP / Server
    Admin or [find their Steam
    Profile](Find_a_Steam_Profile "wikilink").
