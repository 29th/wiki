## Who gets admin?

  - Squad Leaders
  - Assistant Squad Leaders
  - Ranks Corporal and Above
  - Military Police
  - Engineer Corps members (as necessary)

## How do I get admin?

If you are in one of the groups listed above, you will usually have your
admin login details PM'd to you. If this has not happened yet, reply
[here](http://29th.org/forums/index.php?topic=21890.0) stating so and
which group(s) qualifies you to receive admin, and our Access Technician
will get you setup.

## How do I use admin?

If you have your admin login, read the [Server Admin
Guide](http://29th.org/dh/index.php?title=Server_Admin) to learn how to
use admin.

## When can I use admin?

There is only one server admin at a time. The server admin is always the
highest ranked 29th member in the server at the time. Exceptions are as
follows:

  - If the highest ranking 29th member authorizes someone else to 'be
    the admin' instead
  - If the highest ranking 29th member is unresponsive and an issue
    needs to be dealt with
  - If a Military Police officer deems a situation an emergency and does
    not have time to consult the highest ranking 29th member

## What constitutes a Kick / Ban?

### Instant Ban, Without Warning

  - Racism
  - Mass intentional killing of teammates
  - Team killing before leaving the server to "go out with a bang"
  - Any other 'emergency' situation (you will have to explain your
    judgement in the ban log)

### Process for Everything Else

(e.g. things like revenge TKing, [camping
spawn](Spawn_Camping "wikilink"), foul language, disrespecting
admins/the 29th, etc.)

1.  Warn them (When possible, be polite. Maybe they don't know it's a
    rule.)
2.  If they continue, Kick them (If they come back in, warn them the
    next action will be a ban.)
3.  If they continue, Ban them

Note that session bans can be used in exchange for kicks or bans
depending on the severity of the rule being broken.

Remember that most video game servers are a place of anarchy, swearing
and team killing. New players in our server don't know ours is
different. Whenever possible, they should find out by us **telling
them** rather than by us **banning them.**

## Notes on Admin Usage

  - Remember that most video game servers are a place of anarchy,
    swearing and team killing. New players in our server don't know ours
    is different. Whenever possible, they should find out by us
    **telling them** rather than by us **banning them.**
  - **Admins Must Log every Ban in the [ban
    log](Logging_Your_Bans "wikilink") if you don't your ban may be
    removed.**
  - Admins will not discuss bans on the servers under any circumstances
    (instead refer interested parties to the ban dispute thread).
  - Admins, When Kicking for members: if possible warn pubbers that they
    are being kicked for members.
  - Admins will not change Maps when the server is open to the Public
    (Unless instructed). Fixing map changes caused by "server crash" or
    if a scrim/drills is about to take place are the only times
    permitted
  - After drills, admins must reset the server and any changes made to
    the servers settings back to normal
  - Use the words Please and Thank you , this keeps minor situations
    from getting out of hand, and promotes a positive image of the 29th.
