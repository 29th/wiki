## Introducing yourself

For some it might be weird some random guy adding another through Steam,
without knowing him personally. For some it's common. I always start the
chat by saying:

*"Hi\! Do you remember me from the game?" or "Do you remember me from
the 29th server in A3/DH/RS?"*

In order to be remembered, you should had created a connection to him
in-game at first. This doesn't always apply (for example I recruited
Pvt. Nauta without him talking to me in-game at all). In previous topics
I've talked about creating a plan with a pubber, teaming up with a
pubber. These are good ways to get connections and later refer to those
situations:

*"Good game out there\! Had some nice tank ambushing with you\!"*

**\*Hint\*** You should have your \[Set Up Your Steam Profile to
Represent the 29th ID|Steam Community name set\] to your 29th name in
order to avoid confusions

## Talking about recruit, it's all about him

Check his profile, see what's his hrs recorded in DH/RO. If he has less
than 50hrs played for example, you can say something along the lines:

*"I see you're fairly new to DH, how are you liking?"*  
\- With this we're trying to find out why he likes DH. If it's
\[color=red\]realism aspect\[/color\] and
\[color=red\]teamwork\[/color\], these are the winning words for us (it
usually is).

After referring to his gaming experience (feel free to chat about other
games too, if you share common games with him), I usually lead a recruit
to a clan topic. I'll ask something like this:

*"Have you ever been associated with clan business?"*  
\- By this we check his prior realism experience possibly in our games
(HQ and LH only cares if a recruit has prior experience in
RO/DH/DOD/DOD:S units). Also this gives a nice feel for someone without
any prior clan experience, thinking that we think him as a one with that
experience. Sure we want in recruits who are good but skill isn't a
factor if someone is just active and dedicated enough. We train
everyone.

Then you can go on about his experience if he has any, if he has none,
you can move to Step \#3.

## Introducing the 29th ID

After the first two steps comes in the introduction of the 29th.

*"Do you know what the 29th ID is in DH?"*  
"No"  
*"We're a realism unit, do you know what that means?"*  
"lol no sorry"  
*"We portray American unit who fought in WWII, 29th Infantry Division.
It's like WWII reenactment but in an online game"*  
"Oh cool, tell me more"  
*"We use ranks, address others accordingly, we have medals\&awards, we
have highly structured chain of command for 260 members from all over
the world, we have weapon training system, we have leadership training
and then of course we have Basic Combat Training for all new incoming
members"*  
"Sweet\! How do I join?"

This is how simple it can be sometimes. Sometimes it can take 15mins,
sometimes it can take hour(s) or days. After we have his interest, we'll
tell him about the joining process - \[b\]Basic Combat Training\[/b\].
Everyone has gone through it so everyone knows what it is about.
Eventhough for us, BCT is something to weed out the non-29th-types, I
always say this line:

*"In BCT you'll learn basics about the game, about the 29th and
realism"* or a bit longer version *"In BCT you'll learn basics about DH:
engine tricks, grenade throwing, weapon handling, obstacle course.
You'll learn the basics about the 29th: rank structure, chain of command
and what is realism in A3/DH/RS."* (Remember to mention how realism
match works out...)

<span style="color:#FF0000">A recruit can ask sometimes about time
commitments and of course you should inform him the following without
him asking it specifically.</span>

*"BCT lasts from Sunday to Thursday, 7pm GMT/EST, an hour per day."*  
(You can convert the time for recruit's timezone if you know it)  
We are not to tell them that they can pass by only attending 3 days. If
they say they can't attend all five days, use something like:

*"You can miss a day or two in BCT but try to attend as many as you can.
This will make your passing easier."*  
*"After BCT, if you pass, you'll be assigned to a squad/platoon/company
and you will have twice a week mandatory drills; one with your squad,
one with your platoon. Those lasts also an hour per drill."*

## Conquering all the possible issues

Weapon restrictions, no time, age... there are several possible dead
ends with the recruitment speech. But here are ways how to overcome
those:

<u>Weapon restrictions</u>  
"I don't like the idea of having to use rifleman class only"  
\* Everyone has their assigned weapon in the 29th (= knows their role,
knows what they are doing, more efficient)  
\* Prove yourself first as a rifleman, request training for other weapon
after that (rifle is most common and basic weapon in-game, know the
basics first, we don't want everyone running around with sniper rifles
which leads to another point...)  
\* Platoons and squads has certain limits for certain weapons
(historical loadout?) (unlimited rifles, 2xMG, 2xBAR, 2xAT, 2xSMG per
12-men-squad)  
\* Donate $20 for the 29th to help covering the server costs to get the
right to use light weapons and classes with those  
\* Recruiting gives weapons passes (I don't usually even tell about this
but sometimes as a last resort)  
<u>No time</u>  
"I don't have time for the 29th"  
\* After BCT it gets easier, only twice a week mandatory drills (we
don't recquire 100% attendance)  
\* Four different companies with drill times varying from Saturday to
Thursday (surely there are some days he can attend for drills)  
\* If still seems impossible to clear his schedule, use "add nickname"
feature in Steam friendslist and add a note after his name: "Schedule
conflict" and ask him later if his schedule is more free now  
<u>Age limit</u>  
<span style="color:#FF0000">Always ask the recruit's age first instead
of telling him that we have age limit.  
**NEVER TELL AGE LIMIT IN PUBLIC SERVER**</span>  
I ask it casually while recruit is filling up his enlistment.  
"What's your age BTW"  
If +15, no problem  
If underaged, tell him to wait year or two (ask his birthday to mark it
down - for example I have two recruits pending to join in the beginning
of July)
