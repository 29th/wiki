Have a Question or Concern? Questions or concerns should be taken to
your Squad Leader (SL) [rather than "going straight to the
top".](Chain_of_Command "wikilink") Most of the questions you may have
can be answered by your SL, but if they cannot be, your SL will take it
up the Chain of Command (CoC) to your Platoon Sergeant, Platoon Leader
and so on, rather than every single question going straight to the Unit
Commanding Officer.

To send a message to your Squad Leader, there is a small letter icon in
the top left corner of the forums. This represents your inbox and is the
main source of communication in the 29th besides steam messages.

When you click on this, a small drop down box will open. In the top left
of that box it will say "New Message", you click on that to send a new
message. This will take you to a new screen that looks like a
traditional email service. Where it says "Recipients" you put your Squad
Leader's name and select him from you drop down box that will appear.
This ensures you are sending it to that person and makes adding people
to a message easier.

Alternatively, if you have a time sensitive and important concern that
you feel needs to be brought straight to the Unit Commander's attention,
contact Lieutenant Colonel Wheatley.
