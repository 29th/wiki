Any soldier ranked Private, First Class or above may request to use any
weapon in the game (including tanks) in public play. The decision can be
made by any present platoon leadership or above member. The highest
ranking member in the server (who is platoon leadership or above) is
still admin, and thus has the call.

The procedure for asking is to use 'PTU' (Permission to use) and the
name of the class in *all chat (global) at all times* (during drills and
pubplay)  
*"2Lt. Doe, PTU Officer Class?"*

The decision (granted or denied) shall be valid until the player who
requested it leaves the server. Please note that not every request shall
be granted.

Permission to Use (PTU) is a privilege granted to members who have
obtained at least the rank of Private, First Class. Privates are NEVER
to be granted a PTU. In addition, Permission to Use may only be granted
by a member of Platoon leadership or higher, and never by a clerk.

In terms of weapons usage in a closed drill, the drill leader may assign
someone to a specific weapon, regardless of rank. In this case, the
leader is assigning someone for the purpose of the drill, the member is
not requesting usage of the weapon and therefore, this action does not
constitute a PTU thus allowing drill leaders to assign weapons to
Privates if the need should arise. As mentioned earlier, Squad
Leadership does not have the authority to grant a PTU under any
circumstance.
