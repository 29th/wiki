## Vehicles in Squad

With a variety of vehicle types available for usage by Easy Company soldiers, these machines go from main battle tanks, to recon and transport vehicles.

While some of these are available to any rifleman, the heaviest and better armed ones are trusted to the specialized Crewman AIT. For usage in drills, the vehicles available to either side are decided in the drill planning, and can be seen beforehand in the drill brief, alongside the spawn commands for the vehicles in play.

These vehicles can be applied with different rules attributed to them, the most common being the usage of "persistent" vehicles.

Persistent vehicles are not respawned throughout the rounds, they may not be repaired or rearmed unless allowed to, and are lost for the remainder of the drill if destroyed.

The vehicles in play can also be different in a round by round basis, or a team that completes an objective in a raider or campaign type drill can be given more assets.
