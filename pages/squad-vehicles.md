**Rifleman**

The Rifle is the first AIT that everyone who has ever been in the unit, and will ever be, has used. The Rifleman is the default AIT within the the unit; attached to this is a saying: Everyone in the 29th is, first and foremost, a rifleman. Because of this saying, it isn't uncommon for holders of other AITs to still get Rifle check marks. Due to it being used by many people, it's purpose can surprisingly be varied. The Rifle is such a broad weapon that can be used in many ways; from being a long range weapon, to being a CQC weapon. Furthermore, using it reflects your skill in-game overall. Earning your Rifle Marksman Badge is a show that you have mastered the basics and are ready to potentially move to another AIT. Side note: in order to PTU the the sniper AIT, you must have earned a Rifle Sharpshooter Badge.

In squad, nearly every kit is just a different variation of the rifle AIT (with different attachments added for whatever purpose is needed). Each set of factions have different rifles with different calibers. This means a rifle on a certain team may either have more stopping power or be more controllable. Below are the factions and the rifles they use:

**US Army:** M4A1 & M4

**British Army:** L85A2

**Russian Ground Forces:** AK-74M & AKS-74U

**Insurgents (INS):** AKM, AKMS, AMD-65, PM md. 63, AKS-74, FN FAL, G3A3, AKS-74U, & SKS

**Irregular Milita:** AKM, AK-74, AKS-74, FN FAL, M4, & SKS

As listed above, there are many types of rifles that suit different play styles. Conventional forces (US, GB, RUS) may have smaller caliber weapons but they also have an easier time controlling them and putting down more accurate fire. Irregular forces (INS, MIL) may have larger caliber bullets with more stopping power; however, they may be more difficult to control. Depending on the rifle being used, you may need to change your fire rate (or anything else related). This is why it is important, as a rifleman, to learn every weapon associated with the AIT due to the differences.

In the game, typically, a rifleman is more suited for mobility due to their kit being lighter than others. This means that a rifleman can either move from spot to spot as a marksman quickly so that the enemy cannot pinpoint their location, or that they have the ability to rapidly advance on enemy positions. An important factor in the game is stamina and a rifleman will use less of it compared to the other kits; this means that more accurate fire can be put down range while at the same time the individual being incredibly mobile. A good rifleman can mean the difference between victory or defeat. Another very important role that a rifleman brings to the table is the ability to drop an ammo bag. While on the surface, this may look like something as simple as dropping ammo to resupply yourself on, do not be fooled. Paired with a CE, a rifleman and his ammo bag has the potential of being a formidable tank killer team.

**Kits:** Rifleman, Squad Leader, Medic

**Automatic Rifleman**

The Automatic Rifleman AIT, or AR, is probably the least mobile of all the AITs; however, it has constant firepower superiority. While being a very cumbersome AIT, it has the ability to hold down an entire section of the battlefield if placed in a good spot. Yes, the AIT itself is powerful, but the positioning of the AIT is also extremely important. A veteran AR will know what kind of spots to set up in for maximum usage. As has been being stated, the AR AIT itself is a suppression-based AIT. There may be a chance where an AR does not get any kills; however, that is not important as long as there are bullets firing down range. The ARs in-game hold anywhere from 75 - 200 rounds, so there will be plenty to suppress the enemy with. There is a lot of patience associated with this AIT, knowing when to stay behind and knowing when to move up is something that comes with time. Remember: ARs are the anchor that allow a squad to move from position to position while knowing there is constant suppression at their rear. Below are the factions and the ARs they use:

**US Army:** M249 & M240B

**British Army:** L110A2 & L7A2

**Russian Ground Forces:** RPK-74M & PKP

**Insurgents (INS):** RPK & PKM

**Irregular Milita:** RPK-74, Minimi, & PKM
 
**Kits:** Automatic Rifleman, Machine Gunner

**Combat Engineer**

Within Squad, the combat engineer, or CE, is considered the explosives expert of a squad that is responsible for being both an anti-infantry and anti-vehicle role. CEs are equipped with two primary methods of attack: launchers and traps. In regards to the launchers, these are typically meant for anti-vehicle use; however, they can also be used to take out enemy infantry with devastating results. Continuing with this, there are specific rocket-types for each type of target, so be careful to use the correct one when dealing with specific targets. There are fragmentation rounds for infantry use and high explosive anti-tank rounds for vehicles (this includes the tandem round). A well placed fragmentation round has the potential to wipe out an entire squad; a well placed anti-tank round has the potential of either immobilizing a vehicle or even destroying it. These are the things that CEs practice for on a constant basis, which means that learning how to use the AIT and staying alive are an essential part of being a CE.

When it comes to the traps portion of the CE, there are a couple that are similar in nature. Conventional forces get access to a C4 and anti-tank mine. The C4 has a 30 second fuse and is excellent for clearing wreckage and mission objectives with ease. The anti-tank mine is excellent for tracking heavier vehicles and destroying lighter ones. Irregular forces have access to TNT, an anti-tank mine, and an IED. TNT and the anti-tank mine are the same as the conventional forces; however, the IED is detonated remotely. This means that this extra piece of equipment is perfect for setting up ambushes and eliminating groups of individuals.

Whether you are on conventional forces or irregular forces, it is important to understand the capabilities of the CE AIT. One good CE can mean the difference between the enemy having multiple vehicles and them not having any vehicles. So be sure to practice this AIT if you are a CE. Below are the factions and the pieces of equipment they use:

**US Army:** AT-4, M72 LAW, Carl Gustaf, C4, & M15 Anti-tank Mine

**British Army:** AT-4, M72 LAW, C4, & M15 Anti-tank Mine

**Russian Ground Forces:** RPG-7, RPG-26, SZ-1(C4), & TM62 Anti-tank Mine

**Insurgents(INS):** RPG-7, RPG-26, TNT, TM62 Anti-tank Mine, & IED

**Irregular Militia:** RPG-7, RPG-26, TNT, TM62 Anti-tank Mine, & IED
 
**Kits:** Light Anti-Tank, Heavy Anti-Tank, Sapper, Combat Engineer

**Crewman**

The Crewman AIT is quite different than the other ones; instead of mastering a weapon, or set of weapons, the AIT requires an individual to master certain types of vehicles. The heavier vehicles within Squad that have a lot more firepower than a normal transport require this AIT; these vehicles include APCs, IFVs, and tanks. The AIT holder must learn to be proficient with these vehicles due to the combined arms nature of a lot of Easy Company events. This AIT is used, in conjunction with infantry, to complete an objective as efficiently as possible. A holder of the crewman AIT must learn how to combat other vehicles while also being able to support its friendly infantry. On the flip side of this, a crewman must learn how to combat anti-tank threats from enemy infantry as well. Typically, multiple crewman will work together in a single vehicle. If, however, there are no vehicles within a given drill, the crewman will revert to being a rifleman.

**Kits:** Lead Crewman, Crewman

**Grenadier**

The Grenadier is very similar to the rifle AIT; however, there is one key difference: the grenade launcher that is attached to the rifle itself. This launcher is an extremely dangerous accessory due to it being able to shoot 40mm rounds up to 400 meters; it also has the ability to shoot smoke rounds. This is much farther than any grenade thrown by hand, meaning that this is an extremely useful support AIT. With the use of HE rounds, grenadiers have the ability to take out targets or objectives from distance. This is how grenadiers usually operate; after being given a target (or spotting one), they will engage from a distance with explosives. This has the purpose of flushing out enemies from fortified positions or softening up an area for an assault. A grenadier can also use the smoke rounds for various purposes. Smoke can be used to mark areas where targets are for others to suppress and to blind the enemy to your assault. When smoking an area for an assault, be sure to try and get the smoke as close to the enemy as possible. If the smoke lands on the enemy position they will not be able to see but you will be. When not using the grenade launcher attachment, the AIT holder essentially becomes a rifleman.

**Kits:** Grenadier

**Sniper**

The sniper AIT is a very special one due to it being the only platoon-level AIT. This means that there are special circumstances that need to occur in order for an individual to obtain said AIT; mainly: getting a rifle sharpshooter badge. A sniper's role is to be a mobile reconnaissance unit, was well as supporting an infantry assault by eliminating high value targets. Typically, however, the main purpose is for a sniper to relay intel to the team leaders and many squad leaders of the workings of the enemy team. Due to a sniper team mostly comprising of just the individual, it is extremely mobile and can be deployed to any part of the battlefield at a moments notice. It is for this reason that only highly skilled riflemen are considered for the position. Being equipped with magnified optics can go a long way during a drill if utilized correctly. Below are the factions and the snipers that they use:

**US Army:** M110 SASS

**British Army:** L86A2 & L129A1

**Russian Ground Forces:** SVD

**Insurgents (INS):** SVD

**Irregular Milita:** SVD
 
**Kits:** Marksman

**Raider**

This is an exclusive donation AIT. To unlock it, you must have donated at least $20 to the unit. After unlocked, there is usually an unlimited amount of kits allowed in drills due to its inherent nature. The raider is the only true CQC kit, with it's PPSH-41 as a primary weapon; it is especially deadly up close; however, it doesn't do much at range. It is also equipped with two grenades and binoculars.

**Notes**

  - ACOG is allowed depending on the drill scenario.
  - Ammo bag is typically one per squad.
  - AR optics are usually allowed per Easy Company rules.
  - Some AT kits have the option for a rifle optic; however, these are usually not allowed per Easy Company optic restrictions.
  - Crewman AIT is automatically unlocked after the $50 donation goal is met.
  - Conventional forces have no option to remove the grenadier optic; however, this is allowed per Easy Company rules.
  - You need a rifle sharpshooter badge in order to PTU the sniper AIT in drills.
