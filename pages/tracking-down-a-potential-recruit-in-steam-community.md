There are two ways of finding a potential player from Steam Community
while playing (or after playing). One is based on his in-game name, one
is based on his [ROID](http://www.29th.org/roid).

## 1\) In-game name

Open your Steam Community while playing. You can view the profiles
playing with you at the moment.

Alternatively you can view the players whom with you have played in the
past. Open [Steam Community](http://steamcommunity.com/home). Hover
mouse over your profile name, from the dropdown menu go to *"Friends"*.
From there click *"Recently played with"* tab.

## 2\) ROID

**The following applies only in DH**. Tracking down by ROID is the last
resort when you can't find the player in question with his in-game name.
You won't have this issue for example in RO2 or RS since those games
uses your Steam name as in-game name.

Open your console and type *listplayers*. If you don't have time to
write down the numbers, take a screenshot out of it for later use. You
can create a profile link with that ROID. For example my ROID is
76561197970174462. And adding the following in front of it, makes it a
link.

If you are in possession of server admin and can access WebAdmin, this
is a lot easier for you when you can just copy the ROID from the
browser.

same in-game name than Steam Friends, click the arrow in that player's
name and \[i\]"Add nickname"\[/i\]. This helps you remember who is who.
And you can also write short notes if you have already approached the
player. For example I have written "schedule conflict" few times.
