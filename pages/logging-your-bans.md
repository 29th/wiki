Soldiers with the admin privileges to ban players from our game servers
are required to log the ban with details. This ensures that when the
banned player requests to be un-banned, our Military Police know the
context of the ban so they can determine whether it should be lifted.

Any ban that is not logged within one week will be lifted automatically
if disputed. So if you want your bans to stick, make sure to log them\!

Before you ban the player, get their [ROID](ROID "wikilink")/UID/GUID.

After you ban the player, fill out the [<font size="4">Ban Log
Form</font>](http://personnel.29th.org/#banlogs/add) as soon as
possible.

<table border="1" style="background-color:#ffdf76;border-collapse:collapse;border:1px solid #FFCC00;color:#000000;width:100%" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="3">
