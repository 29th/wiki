There are three different ways to get discharged from the 29th Infantry
Division: General Discharge, Honorable Discharge and Dishonorable
Discharged. There are different criterias for each discharge. If you
wish to resign from the 29th, you need to [PM your Squad
Leader](Contact_Your_Squad_Leader "wikilink").

### General Discharge

In General Discharge (or GD) a soldier does not meet the criteria for
Honorable Discharge. This happens for example to soldiers who goes AWOL
(Absent Without Leave) or has not served the minimum of two months
before requesting a discharge. The conditions in GD are the following:

  - The dischargee is welcome in our server and forums, so long as they
    follow the server/forum rules.
  - The dischargee may no longer wear the 29th Infantry Division Tags.
  - The dischargee may reenlist in one month's time, and his application

will be reviewed by Headquarters Staff.

### Honorable Discharge

In Honorable Discharge (or HD) a soldier has requested a discharge
him/herself and there are no disciplinary actions prior the discharge.
Soldier may wear the 29th's tag for retired personnel which is **\[29th
Ret.\]** and is welcome to our servers and forums. As of 07-FEB-2014,
retired members cannot attend drills.

### Dishonorable Discharge

In Dishonorable Discharge (or DD) a soldier has broke the rules in a way
which warrants a discharge from the unit. This can happen by receiveing
three disciplinary demerits within 30 days period or this can happen
over a severe violation. The conditions in DD are the following:

  - The dischargee is not welcome in our server or forums.
  - The dischargee may no longer wear the 29th Infantry Division Tags.
  - The dischargee may not reenlist.
