Quick Switch is a simple weapon trick that halves the time it takes to
equip your pistol sidearm.

All you need to do is to use the 'drop weapon' key when you have your
primary weapon in hand. Your side arm will then appear instantly and
there is no risk that you will accidental fumble by switching to
grenades, smoke or AT weapons first.
