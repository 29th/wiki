With our new [Reserve Platoon](Reserve_Platoon "wikilink") in place, we
have been reviewing the way we handle members who are on active duty,
members who are going to be the reserve pltoon, and those who have
discharged (regardless of status). Following this review, Battalion HQ
has decided that as of now, reserved members will be welcomed graciously
into drills and <b>retired members will be able to attend</b>.

Retired members are not to abuse this policy and will be questioned
regarding high attendance and re-enlistment.

This is left to the drill leader to handle appropriately and contact
their CoC if there are any issues.
