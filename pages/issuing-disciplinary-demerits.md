Soldiers who feel that another soldier should receive a disciplinary
demerit should pass a detailed description of the violation up their own
chain of command (not the violating soldier's chain of command) to their
Platoon Sergeant.

Platoon Sergeants or above who wish to issue a demerit can do so by
posting the detailed description of the violation in the Demerit
Approval forum, to await Headquarters approval.
