ROID is short for Red Orchestra ID (AKA
[SteamID64](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamID#Steam_ID_as_a_Steam_Community_ID)),
and is a 17-18 digit number that, while public information, is unique to
your steam account. ROIDs are used to give admin privileges, to ban
players, etc.

## Get Your ROID

Visit our [Get Your ROID page](http://29th.org/roid) for the two easiest
methods of obtaining your own ROID.

## Get Another's ROID

You may wish to get someone else's ROID to request they be banned or to
find their steam page. There are two easy methods of doing this.

### Using the Console in DH and RO2/RS

While you are in a server, you can open your console and type the
following command:

`listplayers`

It will display a list of the players in the server, as well as their
ROIDs. You can use your mouse scroll to go up and down the list. The
ROID will be listed next to their name, as shown in the example below.

### Using their Steam Community Page

Alternatively, you can get an ROID from any Steam Community Profile
page. The **'Add to your friends list**' link contains the person's ROID
in its URL. Simply right-click it and click 'Copy Link Address' or 'Copy
URL', then paste it somewhere and you have the ROID.

For example, copy the **Add to your friends list** link from [this Steam
Community Profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainwilson/) and
paste it in notepad to get:

<steam://friends/add/76561197961136828>

As you can see, that person's ROID is 76561197961136828
