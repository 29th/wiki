The following tutorial is a definitive guide for everything you need to
know about TeamSpeak 3 (TS3).

## TeamSpeak 3 Tutorial

### Downloads

[Download TS3](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads)

[TSNotifier](http://tsnotifier.cfxxl.de/)

### Installing TeamSpeak 3

1.  In this part of the manual we are covering the TS3 client-side
    setup. If you are interested in setting up your own server, download
    the TS3 server, and then watch this: \[<http://www.teamspeak.com/>?
    page=tutorials\&type=server\]. For any questions or issues about
    setting up a server, please consult the TS3 forums; you will find
    the members to be very friendly and supportive.
2.  Click on the “download TS” link at the top. You will see a number of
    downloads to choose from: download the client that is compatible
    with your Operating System (OS), i.e. download the Windows 7 64-bit
    client if you are running Windows 7\*. Agree to the User License
    Agreement and click "submit". Wait for the download to finish.
      - \*If you are unsure of what OS you are using, go to Start, right
        click on computer/my computer, click properties, and you will
        find your OS type at the top of the properties box.
3.  Open up the TS3 Client. Go through the installation guide and click
    "install". Give it a moment to install the files. Once this is done,
    close the installation setup, and open up the TeamSpeak 3 Client. If
    you've created a desktop icon, double click on this, if not, go to
    Start and search for "TeamSpeak 3 Client".
4.  When it opens, a box may appear saying "Welcome to TeamSpeak". If no
    box appears, go to the toolbar at the top and click Settings, then
    Setup Wizard. Go through the setup guide.
5.  Please be aware: Your rank (Pvt., PFC, Cpl. etc) will show up
    automatically when you are on the 29th TS server.
6.  If you find your microphone doesn't work during the test, make sure
    it is properly plugged in to your computer, and in the correct port.
    Check you haven't physically muted it. If you have further troubles,
    visit the TS3 forums (linked above).

#### Plugins

  - You will get an option to enable plugins. An important plugin is the
    TS3 overlay, as you can see which members of your squad are talking.
    This helps in getting to know your squad better, and if members from
    other squads are in the server, you'll know who is speaking. If you
    choose to install this plugin, you can enable/disable it at any time
    by going to settings \> plugins \> DirectX overlay plugin. A
    comparison between this overlay and TSNotifer can be found in **TS3
    overlay comparison** section

#### Finishing Installation

  - Just before the setup stage is over, you will be prompted to rent a
    TS server and to open up a list of public servers. If you wish to
    rent a server, tick this box. Deselect the public server list box,
    as the server details for the 29th are at the top of this page.

### Connecting to the 29th Server

Information for connecting to the 29th server are at the top of the
page. To connect to the 29th server, go onto connections, connect, and
enter the server details in the appropriate boxes. When entering the
server address, put the port number on the end, like so:
<i>twentyninth.ts.nfoservers.com:35750</i>. If you don’t put
<i>:35750</i> at the end of the address, you will not be able to join
the server.

#### Create a bookmark for the 29th Server

Creating a bookmark ensures you always have quick access to the servers
you want and allows you to avoid having to repetitively type in server
details.

  - Start Teamspeak and click on the
    <span style="color:#000080;background:#DDDDDD">Bookmarks</span> tab.
  - Select <span style="color:#000080;background:#DDDDDD">Add to
    Bookmarks</span> from the drop down menu.
      - Label: Name of bookmarked server. i.e. 29th Infantry Division  
        Address: Host name or plain IP and port. i.e
        63.251.20.99:35750  
        Nickname: Your selected surname (last name). Do not add anything
        but your surname.  
        Server Password: 29th
  - Click <span style="color:#000080;background:#DDDDDD">Apply</span>
  - Click <span style="color:#000080;background:#DDDDDD">Ok</span>

### Finding your Squad's Channel

The 29th server is split up into many different channels. Public
Channels are at the top then Able, Baker, and Charlie Company, Staff
Offices and an Idle channel. For each company, there are 2 or 3
platoons; you will find your squad’s channel in your platoon's section.
For example; if you are in Able Company, First platoon, Third squad
(AP1S3); first you find Able Company, then AP1, and then double click on
AP1S3 to join.

#### Set your Squad Channel as your Default Channel

  - Start up teamspeak and connect to the 29th server.
  - Join the channel you want to default to when ever you start
    teamspeak.
      - This will likely be your squad channel.
  - Go into bookmarks, right and click
    <span style="color:#000080;background:#DDDDDD">Manage
    Bookmarks</span>.
  - Find the <span style="color:#000080;background:#DDDDDD">Default
    Channel</span> field.
  - Click checkmark button next to it
  - Now, click the
    <span style="color:#000080;background:#DDDDDD">Apply</span> button.

Now when ever you join the server through your bookmark you will join
that channel by default

Congratulations\! You now have a fully functioning TS3 client, and you
can communicate with your squad during drills and after drills.

## Settings and options

<table border="1" style="background-color:#ffdf76;border-collapse:collapse;border:1px solid #FFCC00;color:#000000;width:100%" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="3">

<tr>

NOTE:

The following sections are not crucial to using Teamspeak, but if you
wish to learn more about the different options and functions available,
or you are having technical difficulties of any kind, read on.

</td>

</tr>

</table>

This section covers the options in the tool bar at the top of your TS3
client.

#### Connections

In the connections tab, you can type the address of a server to connect
to, disconnect from the current server or all servers, bring up a server
list or quit TS3.

Note: it is possible to connect to more than one server at the same
time. To do this, go to Bookmarks, right click on the server you wish to
join, and select “Connect in new tab”.

#### Bookmarks

The bookmarks tab lets you create and manage bookmarks for servers,
allowing you to access them quickly. You can choose your nickname for
each individual server here. Note: do not put your rank in front of your
name, as this will show up automatically when you join the 29th server.

#### Self tab

The capture, playback, and hotkey profiles are all set to default; these
can be changed in the settings tab. It is important to leave these on
default so you can speak and hear others speaking. You can also state
your current status as “away”, mute your microphone, and mute the
speakers & headphones. Further down, you can change your nickname to
your choice, and set your phonetic nickname, which lets others hear how
to pronounce your name. When setting an avatar, it must be within
300\*300 pixels. The last option is connection info; important
information about your status and bandwidth are here.

  - If you find that your avatar does not appear after setting it,
    delete the "Avatar" file in Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp.

#### Permissions Group

Only applies to admins.

#### Tools

This section will cover important tools.

  - Contacts: To add a user to the contact list, drag the user’s name
    into the contact box. You can decide if you want to be friends with
    this person or neutral, or you can block them. You can allow this
    user to whisper with you, you can block the user, and choose how you
    wish to view them in the channel. More on the whisper function is in
    the Settings section.

<!-- end list -->

  - Client log: If you are experiencing troubleshooting difficulties,
    copy this client log, make a thread in the 29th forums Medical
    office: <http://forums.29th.org/categories/medical-office>, and the
    TS3 troubleshooting section:
    <http://forum.teamspeak.com/forumdisplay.php/99-Client-Support>, and
    paste the log in the thread.

<!-- end list -->

  - Start/stop recording: If you wish to record the activity in your
    channel, click on Start recording. Save the file somewhere you won’t
    lose it. When you are finished recording, click on “Stop Recording”.
    A shortcut for this is ctrl+shift+T. To access the file you recorded
    to, go to the place you saved it.

#### Settings

  - Setup Wizard: run this to quickly configure your settings.
  - Identities: opens up the Identity Manager. Your identity is set to
    default, but you can create new identities. Your identity is
    important because the servers you join will keep a track of your
    login information and permissions. Once the server has your
    identity, you no longer need to enter your username and password
    every time you join.

If you are planning on changing PCs, you can export your identity to a
.ini file and then import it to your target destination. To do this, go
to Settings \> Identities and choose the identity you want to export.
Click Export on the upper right, then choose a filename. On the target
PC you wish to import to, start up TS3, go to Settings \> Identities,
and choose Import then point to the .ini file to complete the import
process. This will allow you to receive the same permissions settings
assigned to you by the server regardless of which PC you're using.

  - Plugins: select which plugins you wish to run.
  - Options

<!-- end list -->

1.  Application: lets you change what language you here notifications
    in, choose which toolbars you want to view, view your ping and
    identity, and manage subscriptions.
2.  Design: lets you customise TeamSpeaks appearance.
3.  Downloads: choose where to download to, and lets you put a limit on
    bandwidth when uploading/downloading.
4.  Security: the server can remember your password and you can set up a
    master password. You can also open up your Identity Manager from
    here.
5.  Playback: change the volume of TeamSpeak and test the playback
    sound.
6.  Capture: here you can set up how you want your microphone to be
    activated, fine-tune your microphone and test the output. The test
    is a good indicator of what others will hear when you speak.
7.  Chat: you can choose how far back you want text chat to be
    remembered, log chat history, and choose how many lines of text chat
    you wish to reload when starting up TS3.
8.  Whisper: choose whether individual settings are used and if users
    are allowed/denied to use the whisper function with you, or deny all
    users.
9.  Hotkeys: custom hotkeys for commands can be set here. To set up a
    whisper key, click the right “add” button, show advanced options,
    scroll down to whisper, open it up and click on “Activate
    Push-To-Reply to a Whisper”. Then, click on “No Hotkey Assigned”,
    choose a key that you won’t accidentally hit, and click “OK”.
    Whisper lets you talk with individual users in your contacts list.
    The reply to a whisper key lets you talk with the user who is
    whispering with you.
10. Messages: lets you leave a message when you are disconnecting.
11. Notifications: If you wish to mute a notification sound (such as
    “User has joined your channel”) you can uncheck the box for the
    relevant sound here.

#### Whisper Lists

![The TS3 Whisper list.](images/TS3_Whisper_list.png "The TS3 Whisper list.")

1.  In Teamspeak, log on to the 29th server, and click on Settings \>
    Options (or just the Alt-P shortcut).
2.  In the Options dialogue, click on Whisper Lists. You should see a
    blank box if you haven't previously created a whisper list.
3.  Click on 'New' and assign a key. This is the key you will be using
    to whisper, so make sure it isn't binded to your current PTT key,
    and that you won't accidentally press it.
4.  To target a client or channel, click on 29th Infantry Division
    drop-down arrow on the right-hand side panel. To choose a client(s)
    to whisper to, double click on the user you wish to communicate
    with, and double click on his name OR drop him into the middle box.
    The same applies for any channel you wish to whisper too. Note:
    everybody in this channel will hear you.
5.  When you have finished, click 'Apply' then 'Ok'.

Your whisper list has now been set up. When you press your whisper key,
only the people in the whisper list will hear you.

The Whisper lists enables the client to talk with specific individuals
who are in the whisper group. A Platoon or Company leader can
communicate with several different squads in separate channels, as long
as they have been included in the list. The applications of this include
(but are not limited to): Leaders communicating with several different
channels at once. This allows better quality communication than Darkest
Hour VOIP provides. Individual squad leaders can separate their squads
into their own sub-channels, allowing them to function as independent
'Fire-teams', while still being able to communicate with the other teams
in the squad. Fire-teams using Whisper is currently in it's infancy in
the 29th ID.

#### Help

The Teamspeak webpage, support forums and tutorials are found here. You
can also rent your own TS server, view your client changelog (which also
tells you which version of TS3 you are running), check for updates and
view the TS copyrights. Teamspeak 3 will update automatically, but it
doesn’t hurt to check for updates about once every month.

## TS3 overlay comparison

#### Inbuilt TS Overlay

[thumb |alt=Example alt text |Inbuilt TS
Overlay](File:Inbuilt_TS_overlay.png "wikilink")

  - Advantages
      - Easy to install.
      - Once enabled, it will always start up when TS3 is running (if
        Notifier is enabled).
      - Overlay can be moved around with the scroll-lock key

<!-- end list -->

  - Disadvantages
      - In some games with anti-cheating enabled, i.e. Punkbuster, you
        may be kicked.
      - Unable to scroll down when a large number of people are in the
        server.

#### TSNotifer

[thumb |alt=Example alt text|TSNotifier](File:TSnotifier.png "wikilink")
Download: [1](http://tsnotifier.cfxxl.de/)

  - Advantages
      - Large number of people can be seen onscreen.
      - There is a tray icon in Windows task bar for easy customisation.
      - The overlay can be moved to various points on-screen, i.e.
        middle-left, centre, top-right etc.
      - Works for TS2 and TS3.

<!-- end list -->

  - Disadvantages
      - Does not start up automatically with TS3.
      - If you start or exit TSNotifier while in a game, the game will
        crash. NB: you can still exit TS3 without crashing.
      - Other applications that use direct3D such as x-fire and Fraps
        may cause problems when the notifier is enabled.
      - Will not work if TS2 and TS3 are ran simultaneously.

#### TSNotifier Installation

Download TSNotifier from the link above.

**Using the installer:** go through the installation guide. Install the
notifier somewhere you can easily find.

**Using the zip file:** open using Winzip, or any other file compression
program. Go to your desktop and create a new folder called TSNotifier.
Move all the TS3HelperPlugin folder and all the files into the
TSNotifier folder.

The next instructions for running TSNotifer are quite long, but they are
clear. Once done, you can run TSNotifier at any time.

Before running the notifier, make sure the inbuilt notifier is turned
off. Open up TS3, go to Settings \> Plugins and uncheck the box called
DirectX overlay plugin. Not doing this may result in a conflict between
the plugins, and the game application crashing. Close TS3 then follow
the next steps.

To run the notifier, double click on TSNotifier.exe. NB: if you use the
notifier often, it is useful to move the .exe to your desktop, or to pin
it to the taskbar. If you have a firewall running such as Comodo, it
will prompt you if you want to allow this program to run; allow for all
messages.

[thumb |alt=Example alt text|Check Darkest Hour will run the notifier by
enabling it in the
gamesettings.ini.](File:TSnotifier_gamesettings.png "wikilink") Before
starting up Darkest Hour, or any other game, check the notifier will run
with Darkest Hour. This is done by going to the task tray at the bottom
right, clicking the arrow, right clicking clicking on TSNotifier, and
selecting Edit gamesettings.ini. Search for RedOrchestra.exe. If you are
using notepad, hold ctrl+f to open the search box, and enter the text
there. Underneath RedOrchestra.exe it must say game.enabled=1 to work
for Darkest Hour. It will also work for RO1 and Mare Nostrum.

When your happy with the settings, close down the notifier. Then,
restart TS3 and the notifier. When playing any game with the notifier
enabled, don’t start up/close the notfier while the game is running, as
it will crash. Note: if the notifier doesn’t start when running Darkest
Hour, close both TS3 and the notifier, and then restart them in any
order. Join the 29th server, and then start DH. If you see TSNotifier
enabled (DX9), and Lobby somewhere on the screen, the notifier is
working.

If the notifier isn't working, go to Settings \> Plugins, and tick the
box TSNotifier Helper Plugin.

**Customising**

From the gamesettings.ini folder shown above, you can choose which games
you want to run the notifier. You can also go to Format \> Font to
change the font type, style, and the size of the text on screen.

To choose where you want the notifier to be on-screen, right click
TSNotifier in the task tray, scroll over Speaker - Position and choose
where you want it to go.

### Backup

To backup your TeamSpeak 3 client, go to your client folder located in:

**Win7 /Vista:** C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\TS3Client

**WinXP:** C:\\Documents and
Settings\\<username>\\Application\\TS3Client

Alternatively, you can find the file by opening "Start" at the bottom
left of your screen, and searching for "TS3Client" if you are using
Windows.

Copy the files called

bookmarks.ini

ts3clientui\_qt.conf

ts3clientui\_qt.secrets.conf

and paste them in any place of your choice, preferably somewhere safe
and easy to find. If you uninstall TS3, or have reason to reinstall,
your bookmarks and settings will still exist upon reinstall. If they
don’t automatically reinstall (you know this has happened if you don’t
have any bookmarks), simply move the 3 files in your backup folder into
the new TS3Client folder, replacing the existing ones. Keeping these
bookmarks can save you time if your contact information is lost.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a techincal problem of any sort that isn't discussed in
this section, please search the 29th Medical Office
[2](http://29th.org/forums/index.php?board=28.0). There is a 32bit and a
64 bit version of TS3. Before going any further, check you are running
the correct version for your Operating System by. Do this by going to
\[Computer/System Properties (TAB \]. Scroll down, and next to 'System
Type' and it will tell you what type your OS is.

#### Microphone support

If others on TS can't here you, then your microphone may have been
incorrectly set up on installation.

  - Make sure you have a “capture profile” selected.

<!-- end list -->

  - If users cannot hear you in TeamSpeak, there may be a simple reason
    for this. Check if you’re using the correct key to talk, make you
    haven’t physically muted your microphone by sliding a switch, check
    you haven’t muted your microphone on TeamSpeak or reduced the
    capture volume, check you haven’t reduced/muted the volume of your
    microphone through the volume icon in the task tray.
      - In the TS settings, in playback and capture settings, set the
        default device to either your sound card (if that is what you
        plug into) and/or if that doesn't work or if your SC isn't
        listed, select the direct sound option.[thumb |alt=Example alt
        text |An example of how to change microphone volume on Windows
        7.](File:TS3_microphone_volume.png "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  - Sometimes, when TeamSpeak is running in the background, push to talk
    no longer works. This is solved by running TeamSpeak as an admin. To
    do this, you must be logged onto your computer as an administrator.
    To run as admin: right click on TS3, and click “run as
    administrator”.

<!-- end list -->

  - If you are using a USB microphone and it is not working, try other
    USB ports.

<!-- end list -->

  - If your microphone still doesn’t work, update your sound card
    drivers.

If other users say your voice is too quiet or too loud, then you can
change the volume of your microphone through the taskbar at the bottom
of your screen. Look for an icon, usually on the right, that looks like
a speaker. Right click on it, and look for something called "sounds" or
"recording devices" etc. A list of available devices should appear.
Right click on the device you are using, select properties, and from
there you should find an option to adjust the volume of your microphone.

#### Should I use push to talk or voice activation?

Voice activation can sometimes pick up background sounds, such as music,
doors opening and closing, or typing. This can be reduced by increasing
the volume needed to activate the microphone, but your voice might not
be picked up straight away.

If you prefer push to talk, make sure you select an easy key use to
activate your microphone. The backward slash ‘\\’ key is a possible
choice. Alternatively you can use buttons on your mouse such as the 4th
or 5th mouse buttons. Make sure it isn’t a key you often use when
typing, otherwise your mic will come on intermittently, which is
annoying for other people in the server.

#### Unable to hear other users speaking

**Important:** update your sound card drivers. If you still can’t hear
sound, go to Help \> Check for Update.

You may get a message saying ‘The configured playback device was not
found’ when connecting to a TS server. If this is the case, go to
Settings \> Options \> Playback and check you are not using another
soundcard. You can also try updating your soundcard or reinstalling the
driver version.

If you cannot hear any sound output through your headphones, try using
speakers instead. There is an unsolved issue where certain headphones,
especially ones using 5.1 surround sound, where the sound is directed to
the speakers instead of the headphones. A work around for some users is
to switch their speaker settings to “stereo”.

#### Unable to connect to server

  - If the “Enter server password” box keeps coming up, and you are sure
    the password is correct, check you have typed out the full server
    address: **twentyninth.ts.nfoservers.com:35750**. If you are still
    unable to connect, check that TS3 isn’t being blocked by your
    firewall.

<!-- end list -->

  - Open up Command Prompt (go to Start, click on the search bar and
    type 'cmd'). Input 'ipconfig /flushdns' and press enter, then close
    the window. Open up Team Speak, then open a new tab in teamspeak
    (left click on bookmarks, right click on one and select 'open
    bookmark in new tab'. Right click on the toolbar in the TS main
    screen and check tabs. Then, log in by using the normal details
    (provided in this wiki) on a separate tab.

<!-- end list -->

  - If you are being repeatedly logged off, and get the message "Failed
    to resolve hostname 'keep-alive'" each time, go to Settings \>
    Plugins \> uncheck DirectX Overlay Plugin.
