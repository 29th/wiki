In the 29th ID, staff offices are various units that are separate from the combat units and exist to perform a specific function within the unit. They are made up of volunteers from across all of the companies in the unit and follow their own chain of command but exist mostly to support the combat units to varying degrees. Unlike real life support units, everyone in the 29th who serves in a staff office also has a primary combat assignment as well with very rare exceptions.

It currently consists of four groups, respectively (S-1) Personnel,
(S-2) Intelligence, (S-3) Operations and (S-4) Logistics:

  - [S-1 Personnel](S-1_Personnel "wikilink")
  - [S-2 Intelligence](S-2_Intelligence "wikilink")
  - [S-3 Operations](S-3_Operations "wikilink")
  - [S-4 Logistics](S-4_Logistics "wikilink")
