<center><b>Introduction</b></center>

The US Army's training programs for specific Military Occupational Specialties(MOS) are individually referred to as <u>Advanced Individual Training</u>(AIT). 

In the 29th, this term has been borrowed to refer to its system of restricting weapon usage and weapons training with the games it is officially deployed in. The 29th's AIT System restricts what weapons and equipment is available in game by:
1. Assigning each member a role(Rifleman, Submachine Gunner, etc) that limits the weapon classes they can use. These roles are also referred to as AITs. (Rifleman AIT, SMG AIT, etc)
2. Limiting the number of said AITs that are allowed per squad, and therefore the team as a whole.

This system is used to:

-Ensure realistic and balanced ratios of roles and weapons within a squad.
-Encourage specialization of skill and knowledge that 
<ul>
<li>can be passed down between current and future AIT holders.</li>
<li>is used to greatly increase the effectiveness of a weapon in a squad.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
Each company often has rules or SOPs(Standard Operating Procedures) that further limit equipment usage in the interest of realism and/or balance. Other games the 29th are deployed in, such as RS2 and Squad, are created with the intent of being team vs team shooters, and use classes for (weapon) balance and role variety. This makes it much easier for the companies associated with those games to clarify or even automatically restrict (by mods/server settings) usable equipment. Arma 3 in comparison is built as a sandbox game and therefore focuses on variety and choice, not balance. The 29th Training Mission(link here) does not automatically restrict equipment to give drill leaders flexibility when planning drills. Therefore, unless otherwise stated by drill leader or qualified leadership, all 29th members are to follow the <u>Charlie Company SOP</u>(link to SOP?) for every Arma 3 drill.

More rules regarding AIT usage can be found at 29th Rules and Regulations(link to specific part).

The following is the ideal makeup of a squad, based on the squad's size. If a squad decreases in size, Squad Leaders do not have to eliminate positions to meet these requirements; however, if one of the positions becomes vacant, it should not be filled until the size increases to meet these guidelines.

- Squads with 2 Automatic Riflemen will classify them as 'First Class Automatic Rifleman' or 'Second Class Automatic Rifleman' based on seniority and activity.
- The Sniper AIT is assigned to a Platoon, not a Squad.

<center><b>Rifleman</b></center>
The Rifleman is the default AIT in the 29th, and it is often said that everyone in the 29th is first and foremost, riflemen. The rifle is the primary tool of engagement in fire fights, and the majority of AITs have a rifle as a primary piece of equipment. Therefore, the rifleman has a huge overlap in combat role with other AITs. Furthermore in the 29th, your skill with the rifleman AIT reflects on your skill in the game as a whole, and therefore it is common for user of other AITs to receive Rifle badge check marks. A Rifle Marksman badge can signify you have mastered the basics, and are more than ready to move on to more specialized AITs, while a Rifle Sharpshooter badge is mandatory to PTU or be considered for the Platoon Sniper AIT.
&ensp;
The rifleman in Arma 3 is lightly equipped compared to his AR and CE counterparts, but this is not a negative quality, as it makes the rifleman extremely versatile by being one of the most mobile elements of a squad. Good riflemen and squad leaders will use this mobility to rapidly advance into favorable positions, and much better stamina compared to other AITs will mean they will likely come out on top in surprise close range engagements by either out-aiming and/or out-positioning the enemy. These quality also makes the rifleman the perfect member of the squad to execute flanks (the loss of a rifleman is also not as detrimental to the firepower of a squad as losing an MG). Overburdened Combat Engineers and Automatic Riflemen can also request for a rifleman to share the weight of their loadouts, indirectly increasing the effectiveness of their squad mates.

<u>Notes</u>
- Battle Rifle can only be PTU'd by PFCs with Rifleman Marksman AQBs or higher.
- A rifleman can choose to become a non-official medic in their squad by picking the Medic role in lobby selection. This allows the player to give blood transfusions to other players. (Not limited to but best suited to this AIT.)
___
<center><b>Automatic Rifleman</b></center>
The Automatic Rifleman's role can best described as 'a mounted MG that learned to walk'. Their job is closely related to the increased firepower they bring to a squad, and include establishing fire superiority through suppressive fire and locking down sections of the battlefield once in a favorable position. Automatic Riflemen should note that the firepower they bring to a squad comes at a cost, decreased mobility compared to the rifleman class. It is up to them to find a balance between weapons(ex. the lighter M249 vs the increased range and power of the M240B) and amount of ammunition, and the weight it adds to their loadout. After all, firepower means nothing if it can't get to the right spot or hit anything because someone decided to be a pack mule. Terrain, scenario(A/A, A/D, etc), and duration of mission should be considered while editing a loadout.

<u>Notes</u>
 - Also sometimes referred to as the Heavy AIT.
[spoiler]
<u>Equipment</u> 
- Machine Gun
- Assault Rifle w/ Extended Magazines 
<u>Roles</u>
- Mobile suppression and base of fire
<u>Notes</u>
 - Automatic Rifleman should consider terrain, scenario(A/A,A/D, etc), and duration of mission in choosing armament (5.XX vs 7.62 mm) and ammunition carried.
[/spoiler]
___
<center><b>Crewman</b></center>
The Crewman AIT in Arma 3 is a combination of the Crewman and Pilot roles, and is responsible for all non-transport vehicle assets. However, the Crewman is expected to also crew transport vehicles(helicopters and armed transports especially) if no other vehicles are available. The Crewman must therefore be proficient and comfortable in the use of a wide variety of vehicles. The importance of such assets means that they will often be working with other crewmen for maximum effectiveness, and expected to communicate with their platoon (and possibly company) directly to direct fire and pass along intelligence. However, vehicles are not always present in drills, and in these instances, Crewmen revert to a Rifleman role in the squad. 

<u>Notes</u>
- The two crewmen in a squad are expected to train together to ensure familiarity and effectiveness, even outside of official drills.
- Taking the CE or Engineer slots in the lobby allows a crewman to use Full Repair on vehicles with a toolkit (when allowed).
[spoiler]
<u>Equipment</u> 
- Vehicles (Air and Armor)  (link to vehicles page)
<u>Roles</u>
Pilot - Responsible for all airborne assets (except transport helicopters)
Crewman - Responsible for all armored vehicles and assets (IFVs and Tanks)
<u>Notes</u>
- While transport helicopters can be flown by any AIT, it is still implied that crewmen should be the first to volunteer (or voluntold) to fly these assets.
- If neither roles are available, crewmen revert to being standard riflemen in a squad. However, they are commonly assigned to transport vehicles as drivers and gunners when needed. 
- The two crewmen in a squad are expected to train together to ensure familiarity and effectiveness, even outside of official drills.
- Taking the CE or Engineer slots in the lobby allows a crewman to use Full Repair on vehicles with a toolkit (when allowed).
[/spoiler]

<center><b>Combat Engineer</b></center>
The Combat Engineer is considered the explosives expert in a squad and responsible for the destruction of enemy assets and hard points. The CE's launchers are primarily meant for anti-vehicle use, but can be devastating against infantry with the right rockets equipped. However, the types of launchers(Disposable/Multi-Shot/Lock-on) a CE can carry is restricted by the drill, and the launchers assigned often imply the role a CE is expected to do on the battlefield. Single-shot launchers are the standard, and implies a lack of (armored) vehicles. Multi-shot launchers tend to imply the enemy have heavier vehicle assets, while guided launchers almost certainly imply heavily armed ground or air assets. 
&ensp;
The CE also carries demolition explosives which use varies on the drill. In missions where the objective is to destroy an immobile enemy asset such as ammo caches or radar stations, they are a necessity. Otherwise, they can be used as makeshift IEDs to ambush infantry or light vehicles, or even forgo it all together to save weight in a loadout. In rare occasions where it is needed, CEs are also expected to be the ones to carry a defuse kit or minesweepers.
&ensp;
Combat Engineers are expected to play cautiously if they are needed to eliminate armor or an enemy controlled objective; in these instances, they are easily the most important members of the squad, and must be treated and protected as such. They can afford be more aggressive when their role does not involve vehicle or asset destruction, using their rockets or demo blocks to flush out infantry in a role similar to the grenadier. 
&ensp;
Combat Engineers also encounter a weight problem similar to Automatic Rifleman. Consider if you NEED that many rockets in your kit. If you do, then consider if a Rifleman can carry some for you.

<u>Notes</u>
- CEs are expected to carry the demolition explosives in a squad, but it is not limited to the AIT. Consider having a rifleman in the squad carry them instead if weight/role redundancy is an important factor in the mission.
-Backblast should always be considered when choosing when and where to fire a launcher. However, having to fire in a position where backblast may knock one unconscious may be favorable to one where they are exposed to more lethal enemy fire.
[spoiler]
<u>Equipment</u>
- RPG Launcher(Single or Multi-Shot)/Recoilless Rifles
-Explosives
<u>Roles</u>
 - Varies on assumed enemy assets and mission objectives. 
- Anti-vehicle/armor 
- Destruction of mission objectives(ammo caches, strategic assets). 
- Otherwise relegated to flushing out enemy infantry with assorted explosives in a role similar to the grenadier.
<u>Notes</u>
- The launchers assigned/available often imply/limit the role a CE is expected to do on the battlefield. Single-shot launchers are the standard, and implies a lack of (armored) vehicles. Multi-shot launchers tend to imply the enemy have heavier vehicle assets, while guided launchers almost certainly imply heavily armed ground or air assets.
- CEs are expected to carry the demolition explosives in a squad, but it is not limited to the AIT. Consider having a rifleman in the squad carry them instead if weight/role redundancy is an important factor in the mission.
-While not limited to CEs, they are expected to carry defuse kits/minesweepers when the situation calls for it.
[/spoiler]
___
<center><b>Submachine Gunner</b></center>
The Submachine Gunner is best seen as a variant of the Rifleman who carries a shorter ranged weapon in the form of a machine pistol, PDW, or shortened assault rifle. Similarly to the rifleman, the role of the SMG AIT is to close in and engage the enemy due to their mobility and armament. He can also choose to carry ammunition for the CE or MG due to his light loadout weight. 
&ensp;
Sadly however, the SMG AIT is one rarely used in Arma due to its lack of effectiveness. Simply put, the assault rifle out-ranges the SMG past 75 meters, and is still just as effective as the SMG within those 75 meters. The SMG is lighter than the rifles and has a shorter length, but these advantages are too small or situational, respectively, to justify taking an SMG over a rifle. As the only difference between the kits of a Rifleman and SMG is the weapon, the SMG can be considered objectively inferior to the Rifleman AIT.
&ensp;
Anyone who has donated 20 dollars or otherwise has access to an SMG can consider equipping a machine pistol(where available) over a regular pistol. This would give increased back-up firepower in sticky situations, in exchange for increased loadout weight. (Need verification on this.)

<u>Notes</u>
 - Also sometimes referred to as the Light AIT.
[spoiler]
<u>Equipment</u> 
- Submachine Guns/PDWs/Shortened Assault Rifles
<u>Roles</u>
- Close in and engage enemy. 
- Carry ammunition for other members of the squad.
<u>Notes</u>
[/spoiler]
___
<center><b>Grenadier</b></center>
The Grenadier is equipped with a grenade launcher commonly mounted onto his rifle, although standalone variants can be used. These launchers can lob 40mm HE grenades far further than any man could throw a grenade, which gives the squad increased versatility in eliminating enemy infantry at range. It is very important for Grenadiers to keep in mind that they should use 40mm HE in a similar role to regular fragmentation grenades, which include flushing out enemy troops in cover or to soften a position for an assault. It should not primarily be used as a suppression tool, this is the role of the MG and a waste of the small amount of rounds you receive. 
&ensp;
The Grenadier also fulfills a support role when necessary with its smoke and flare GL rounds. Smoke can be used to mark targets/locations for focused fire (especially for vehicles) or to mask movement, and flares are used for illumination at nighttime. (Especially useful for GRNFOR Independent as they do not have NVGs.) BLUFOR Grenadiers also have access to the HuntIR, a launchable camera that that can be used for surveillance as it parachutes down from the sky.

<u>Notes</u>
- Smoke rounds have a tendency to bounce off the ground and land much farther away, try to undershoot these rounds.
- GL rounds have a tendency to get caught in tree foliage, ensure that the round’s path is clear before firing.
[spoiler]
<u>Equipment</u> 
- Standalone/rifle mounted grenade launcher
<u>Roles</u>
- Flush out entrenched/holed up infantry with explosive rounds
- Launch smoke for marking targets/locations or to mask movement
- Launch flares for nighttime illumination
- Use HuntIR to monitor enemy movement (BLUFOR only)
<u>Notes</u>
- Grenadiers should NOT use GLs to suppress the enemy, this is the job of the AR and Riflemen, and a complete waste of ammo.
- Grenadier effectiveness varies greatly by terrain, they are non-replaceable in urban environments but can be forced to primarily fill a rifleman role in other engagements.
- Smoke rounds have a tendency to bounce off the ground and land much farther away, try to undershoot these rounds.
- GL rounds have a tendency to get caught in tree foliage, ensure that the round’s path is clear before firing.

<center><b>Sniper</b></center>
The Sniper AIT is a trained marksman whose role is to provide reconnaissance from a concealed position and if necessary, to eliminate high value targets to support the platoon's advance or defense. They operate independently of their squad, and communicate with Platoon Leadership spotted enemy positions and assets. The Sniper is equipped with a Battle/Bolt Action Rifle with a Magnified Optic and a Rangefinder to assist him in his role.
&ensp;
Snipers should note that the most effective sniper is one that enemy is unaware of. Quite often, the valuable intel a sniper provides to his team is more important than the shots he takes. Said intel should ideally prevent the team from being a position where the Sniper must fire his weapon to save them. When firing his weapon, the sniper must decide if doing so will give away his position, and if it does, is worth taking the shot. Shots that be considered worth taking include: the enemy sniper, leadership, CEs to protect vehicle assets, and lastly MGs. If a sniper is spotted, he can expect but should not rely on the enemy being past effective range to land initial shots accurately, and should relocate immediately until he is no longer the enemy's focus.
[spoiler]
<u>Equipment</u> 
- Battle Rifles/Bolt Action Rifles with Magnified Optic
- Rangefinder
<u>Roles</u>
- Reconnaissance
- Elimination of high payoff targets
<u>Notes</u>
- Sniper kit will only be taken when Drill Leader specifies.
- Sniper AIT can only be PTU'd by PFCs with Rifleman Sharpshooter AQBs or higher.
[/spoiler]
___
<center><b>Leadership</b></center>
Not considered an AIT as much as it a role, this section refers to all members assigned a squad level or higher leadership position. While these members are allowed to use most of the weapons on the battlefield (except sniper rifles), their role is not one that primarily involves combat.
&ensp;
Leadership have two primary roles. First, they are the main link between their element and the next step up the CoC, and carry long range radios to ensure this connection remains reliable over range. They are responsible for directing intel and possible courses of action up the Chain of Command, and receiving orders that their unit is expected to execute. The second role of leadership is to lead their unit to complete orders sent down the CoC, ensuring that the element stays organized and effective as they inevitably take contact and losses.
&ensp;
Lower level leadership (Squad Leaders) can use their Rangefinders to assist in directing fire by giving ranges and adjusting fire, whether this be suppressing fire from a MG or rockets from a CE. The range information can also be used to provide better marks on the map of enemy locations. Leadership should also remember that they have access to most of the weapons of the battlefield; in a pinch, they can pick up MGs, GLs, or launchers off the battlefield to support their squad in a direct combat role.
[spoiler]
<u>Equipment</u> 
- Rangefinder
- Long-Range Radios
<u>Roles</u>
- Direct information up the CoC and relay orders down
- Lead their unit/element in order to fulfill said orders or mission objectives
- Assist in Directing Fire with Rangefinder
<u>Notes</u>
- Long-Range Radios can be switched for a different/no backpack in smaller scenarios
