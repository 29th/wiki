  - The Abrams present the highest capacity for infantry fire support out of all the MBTs with its high ammount of HE shells, but its worth mentioning that while it is a force to be reckoned with, as every other vehicle, it works best with the support of infantry to make sure it survives the fights.
  - While it gives the option for additional firepower with the loaders HMG, it is a exposed open top gun, making the loader vunerable to small arms, making it a suitable option only for long range engagemnts.
  - With the exception of the T-62, the Abrams is the MBT with the largest weak spots in its frontal armor.

  - The Bradley is a powerful IFV, capable of great fire support, and able to take out any enemy vehicles it encounters, even tanks if it catches its enemy off guard with its TOW missiles.
  - It is faster and more maneuverable than all of its counterparts.
  - Ammo storage is located under the turret, a well placed shot from the side can destroy the Bradley in one hit.
