After each drill and After Action Report or AAR is written containing a
summery of the drill and a list of people who attended the drill. If you
where due to attend the drill, the AAR can be found in you [Personnel
File](Personnel_File "wikilink") in the Attendance Record by clicking on
the name of the drill. The AARs for all drills can be found in the
[Drill Calendar](Calendar "wikilink").

AARs for platoon or [company drills](Drills "wikilink") are usually
written by [platoon clerks](Platoon_Clerk "wikilink"). AARs for [squad
drills](Drills "wikilink") are usually written by the [Squad
Leader](Squad_Leader "wikilink") or assistant squad leader. However,
anyone who is authorised to do so by the drill leader may write the AAR.

It is the responsibility of the drill leader to ensure that the AAR is
completed promptly and accurately within 24 hours of the drill.
