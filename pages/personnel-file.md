Your Personnel File contains information about you and your progress in
the 29th ID. Your own file can be found here by Clicking on your name at
the top of the forum then clicking on your name in the right side bar.

The personnel file is permanent, so even if you leave the unit and
rejoin at a later time, your details are kept. If any information is
found to be incorrect on your personnel file, you should [Contact Your
Squad Leader](Contact_Your_Squad_Leader "wikilink").

Other members' files can be found in the [Roster](Roster "wikilink").

Every profile is split up into several sections accessed by clicking on
the different tabs:

## Profile

The profile section contains basic information such as the member's
squad assignment, and any staff assignments. It also contains a link to
their steam profile page. This is the easiest way to find a member's
Steam profile. Additionally, if a member is currently on an [Extended
Leave Of Absence](Extended_Leave_Of_Absence "wikilink") this is
indicated by \*\*"(ELOA)"\*\* next to their name.

## Service Record

The Service Record section lists transfers, promotions, awards, and
staff assignments in chronological order. Each item listed has a
hyperlink which will navigate you to the announcement thread for that
event.

## Attendance

Shows a breakdown of the person's [Drill
Attendance](Drill_Attendance "wikilink"). Clicking on any of the listed
drill dates will take you to the [After Action
Report](After_Action_Report "wikilink") for that drill. A designation of
\*\*\*AWOL\*\*\* in the status column indicates a missed drill. AWOL
with no colour means an [absence](Need_to_Miss_Drills? "wikilink") was
recorded but no reprimand was generated. a red AWOL indicates a missed
drill that caused an attendance reprimand. Excused indicates the member
has enacted a LOA for that drill
