When you reply to a post by a public player on the forums, you represent
not only yourself but the entire 29th. If the topic is mundane,
something such as "Do you like turkey?", then post away. If the topic is
serious, let a higher ranking 29th member reply to it. Your reply may do
more harm than good.
