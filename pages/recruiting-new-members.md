Recruiting is extremely beneficial to the unit. However, there is a
right way and a wrong way to go about recruiting.

  - Do not try to recruit by using "Spam" in game and be careful who you
    recruit.
  - Never tell anyone that there is an age limit for entry to the 29th.
  - Recruitment is best done via Steam Friends, not in public.
  - It doesn't matter who you recruit, how skilled they are, how old
    they are or even if they follow the server rules. Let Lighthouse
    weed them out.

## How to Recruit

Here are a few methods that will help you recruit members:

  - Always follow the rules and guidelines for [Dealing With Public
    Players](Dealing_With_Public_Players "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  - Pay attention to how people react to events in the game. If someone
    says something like "I gotta get better at this game" or "I hate
    playing with immature kids.." These are good indicators as to how
    you should pitch recruitment into the 29th for this player.

<!-- end list -->

  - Be personable; most players want to be treated as people when being
    asked to join a unit. Greet public players when they enter the
    server. They will feel very welcome if when they come in they see
    three "Hey (name) what's up" or hear it on the microphone. Take time
    to talk to players, especially about the 29th and realism. If you
    continue this after they enlist they will stand a far better chance
    of finishing BCT.

<!-- end list -->

  - Look for active team players and leaders. Check the scoreboard from
    time to time and check out the public players with good kill to
    death ratios. Try being an in-game leader and look at those who
    respond well to it and take part in it. Players like that will
    benefit a realism unit. Let them know this when you approach them.

<!-- end list -->

  - Players often put it aside and say "I will get to it later...". You
    must try to avoid this, lest they but it off for good. Encourage
    them to enlist straight away. Saying "This weeks Training Platoon is
    full but if you enlist now, I'll make sure you get in and don't have
    to wait a few weeks." is a good way to make their enlistment more
    urgent.

<!-- end list -->

  - Public realism scrimmages are a great place to recruit new members.
    Let them know that if they are enjoying the scrimmage, they should
    consider enlisting.

## Benefits of Recruiting

If you recruit someone into the 29th you will have helped the unit.
Because of this, there are benefits and rewards that come with
recruiting.

### Weapons Passes

[Weapons Passes](Weapons_Passes "wikilink") are awarded for each cadet
you recruit.

### Combat Action Badges

If a soldier obtains three recruits in one training platoon, he is
awarded a [Combat Action Badge, 1st Award](Awards "wikilink"). Five
recruits in one week earns the CAB 2nd Award; Seven recruits earns the
CAB 3rd Award; and Nine recruits earns the CAB 4th Award.

### Recruiters Badge

The [Recruiters Badge](Awards "wikilink") is a highly revered award
which is awarded to those consistent in recruiting. Very few people in
the unit have this because it requires someone who is actually committed
to getting recruits for the unit, which improves the 29th. It is not
about number, it is about consistency; it is about not giving up after
you get your CAB awards.

### Keep Your Recruits

When it is convenient for the unit and the recruit, those graduating BCT
are places in the same Platoon as their recruiter.
