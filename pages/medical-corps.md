The Medical Corps is a Staff Office within [S-4
Logistics](S-4_Logistics "wikilink") that is responsible for providing
comprehensible help for 29th members with any technical issues they may
have. The corps consists of several technicians, and clerks, who's main
functions are:

  - Assist with any technical issues the 29th members may have.
  - Suggest methods in which the members of the 29th can get their
    computers to work better with the games the 29th inhabits.
  - Creating general guides for issues which are common.

## Posting an issue, and contacting technicians

Resolving an issue can typically be done by posting [this
template](http://forums.29th.org/categories/medical-office) in the
relevant forum thread (browser issue, in-game issues, etc.)

Otherwise, technicians can be contacted either by PM or by finding them
on Steam. This can be done by viewing the [Medical Corps Staff
List](http://personnel.29th.org/#units/Med) and messaging the technician
or by [finding their Steam Profile](Find_a_Steam_Profile "wikilink").
