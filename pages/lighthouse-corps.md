The Lighthouse Corps is a Staff Office within [S-3
Operations](S-3_Operations "wikilink") that is responsible for training
cadets who wish to join the 29th, and help them along the way. Once a
cadet passes this initial period of introduction, he is then assigned to
a squad within the 29th. The corps consists of several drill
instructors, assistant drill instructors, enlistment liaisons, steam
community secretaries and recruitment officers, who's main
responsibilities are:

  - Providing cadets with a comprehensible introduction into the 29th in
    their chosen game, otherwise known as Basic Combat Training (BCT)
  - Ensuring, via Steam Groups and Events and PM reminders, that the
    cadets know when and where they have BCT classes
  - Answering any questions they may pose, from their acceptance into
    BCT until their graduation
  - Lastly, providing tips and guides that help 29th soldiers recruit
    new cadets

NOTE:

Since the 29th is spread out amongst three games, there are drill
instructors for each game. This means that cadets will attend BCT in the
game they want to, and will then be assigned to a squad that uses that
game.
