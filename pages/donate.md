## How to donate?

Go to [www.29th.org/donate](http://29th.org/donate) and set up your
donation there. You can either make one-time donation at any amount you
want or you can set up a recurring donation from $3 up to $50.

After you have donated, send a PM to [T/5
Lacey](http://forums.29th.org/messages/add/Cpl.%20Lacey) with the email
address you used to donate, so that your donation can be identified as
coming from you.

## Where does my donation go?

100% of Donations go to paying for 29th ID expenses. Below are listed
monthly expenses:

  - $227 for game servers, bought from [Nuclear
    Fallout](http://www.nfoservers.com/)

## Rewards for donating

If a soldier donates total of $20, he/she may use the Thompson
submachine gun in pub play, scrims, and even during drills if needed.

and posted in [Promotions and

will earn a-two-day [weapons pass](Weapons_Passes "wikilink"). Once a
donation is processed, send a PM to a [Finance
