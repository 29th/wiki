CORDS, or **C**lose **O**rder **R**ifle **D**rill is a short ceremonial
drill. It is used both as a demonstration of respect towards other units
or high ranking members and a way of maintaining discipline within the
unit.

Close Order Rifle Drills are always performed when lined up and starting
from the position of attention. The [M1 Garand](M1_Garand "wikilink") is
always used.

There are seven basic commands that make up CORDs. This list should be
memorized, and you will have to know what they mean at Basic Combat
Training when you practice them.

1\. **Attention** - Grenades out, facing forward.

2\. **Present Arms** - Rifles out, facing forward.

3\. **Ready** - Reload

4\. **Aim** - Look 45 degrees up, sight in, look 45 degrees left. Done
in exactly 5 seconds.

5\. **Fire** - Wait for one second, then fire one round (Count "one one
thousand" then fire). This is repeated until rounds are depleted.

6\. **Order Arms** - Look 45 degrees right, sight out, look 45 degrees
down. Done in exactly 5 seconds.

7\. **Parade Rest** - Grenades out, facing forward.
