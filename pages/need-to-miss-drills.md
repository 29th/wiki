We understand that everyone has a life outside the 29th and will
occasionally have to miss drills. What we ask is that you make us aware
of your absence. If you need to miss a specific drill, you simply 'Post
A Leave of Absence' for it within 24 hours of the drill time. If you
need to miss a series of drills, (due to a trip, etc.), you can post an
'Extended Leave of Absence' for up to 45 days. However, if your drill
times consistently do not work for you, you may be able to transfer to
another platoon which has different drill times.

Please remember to [message your Squad
Leader](Contact_Your_Squad_Leader "wikilink") to let him know when you
won't be at drills.

Be aware that if you miss 3 drills within 30 days and do not post a
leave of absence (unless you are on extended leave of absence) you will
be [discharged](Types_of_Discharges "wikilink").

## How to Post Absence

This is to be done when you need to miss a specific drill, regardless of
the reason. You first click on "Personnel" and a drop down box will
appear.

Inside of this drop down box, there will be different links. These take
you to various parts of the 29th's website. You need to click on
"Calendar". This will take you to the calendar of events for the 29th.
This shows all drills and special events that are scheduled for the
selected month.

Next, you need to find the specific drill you will miss and click on it.
This will take you to the page for that drill, in the upper right corner
there is a button that says "Post LOA". You need to click this if you
intend on missing the drill.

## How to Post An Extended Leave of Absence (ELOA)

This is to be done when you need to miss a series of drills, for up to
45 days in a row. Please do not abuse this option. To post an ELOA, go
the [Extended LOAs](http://forums.29th.org/categories/extended-loas)
(Child Board of Adjutant Office) on the forums.

Follow these instructions:

1\. Create a new thread in the adjutant office section on the forums  
2\. The topic name of the thread should be as follows \[Example: <b>ELOA
- Campbell - 7th Jan to 28th Jan 2014</b>\]  
3\. Inside the topic please place your full name, the reason and
availability as follows  

> Name: David J. Campbell  
> Reason: New working shift  
> Availability: Forums only

4\. An Adjutant Corps member will then deal with your ELOA ASAP and
reply when the record would have been added.  
Remember to [notify your Squad
Leader](Contact_Your_Squad_Leader "wikilink").

## How to Change Drill Times

If your drill times consistently do not work for you, you may be able to
transfer to another platoon with better suited drill times. To do this,
[message your Squad Leader](Contact_Your_Squad_Leader "wikilink") with
what times work best for you and he will be able to help you follow it
through. For an idea of the possible options, look at the Calendar.
