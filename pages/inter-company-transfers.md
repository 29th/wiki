If a soldier in the 29th ID wishes to transfer to a different company in
the unit in order to change his primary game, he shall send a PM to his
ASL/SL via the forums requesting a transfer to that specific company
along with his current availability to make drills. This information is
then passed up the member's CoC to his Company Commander who will then
contact the new company's Company Commander via PM to discuss a
transfer.

Let it be noted, attendance and disciplinary record will be taken into
account when reviewing a transfer. Company HQ reserves the right to deny
any transfer. In addition, soldier should remember that loss of AIT,
rank, or position may be necessary upon transfer.

## Restrictions

No voluntary transfer will be granted for a soldier who has received a
disciplinary demerit in the last 30 days.

Transfers into a platoon slated to be officially deployed will be
suspended prior to the announcement of the scrimmage.

Transfers into a company preparing for an intra-company tournament such
as "BOTS" will be suspended prior to the announcement of the event.

A soldier may not request more than one voluntary transfer in a 90 day
period.

A soldier may not request a specific squad when transferring between
companies, placement will be based on availability and company needs.
