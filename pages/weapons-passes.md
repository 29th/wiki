Weapons Passes are issued to soldiers for recruiting new cadets and for
[recurring donations](Donate "wikilink"), and authorise the soldier to
use any weapon/class they want for the duration of the pass.

## Benefit

Use of any weapon or class in our servers for the duration of the pass.

  - Includes sniper and tank as well
  - Applies to public play, scrimmages, and drills

## Duration

Weapons passes will say on them the start date and end date. The benefit
starts on midnight of the start date and ends at 23:59 on the end date.

  - For 1 recruit, soldier is awarded a 2 day pass, generally starting
    Friday and ending Saturday (issued on a graduation day of the
    Training Platoon your recruit was in)
  - For each additional recruit that week, soldier is awarded an
    additional 1 day pass
  - For a recurring donation, soldier is awared a 2 day pass. The dates
    of the pass needs to PM'd to a [Finance
    Clerk](http://29th.org/personnel/staff/?job=122)

## Notes

  - Having a pass does not entitle you to disobey orders from a superior
    ranking member
  - Having a pass in a scrimmage does not always mean you will get to
    use whatever you want - you are simply able to if the scrimmage
    leader allows you to
  - Cadet's enlistment must be accepted

## FAQ

### How do I know when I have a weapons pass?

You will see a notification at the top-right of the forums that looks
like this:

![weapons-pass.jpg](weapons-pass.jpg "weapons-pass.jpg")

### What if my recruit didn't put my name down as his recruiter?

Report this in the [Claiming Your
Recruit](Claiming_a_Recruit "wikilink").

### What if I won't be around during the dates on my weapons pass?

Notify the Recruitment Secretary of this and he can change the dates.
The recruitment secretary's name is on the bottom of the weapons pass.

### What if I didn't realise I had a weapons pass?

There isn't anything we can do if you didn't log in the forums to see
that. If you recruited someone, you should be checking the enlistment
office to make sure he recruited anyway, and when you see that he was
accepted, you should expect to have a weapons pass that weekend.

### I got a recruit - why haven't I received a weapons pass?

You can contact [Recruitment
Secretary](http://29th.org/personnel/staff/?job=8) about this matter.
Please keep in mind that your recruit has to be accepted into a BCT.
Pending, denied and withdrawn enlistment doesn't get you any passes.
Also keep in mind that weapons passes are issued on a graduation day.
(For example if you recruit someone a month before the recruit's BCT
would start, for that recruit in question your pass will be issued on
that TP's graduation day.)
