Voice communication via Teamspeak or ingame chat gives us a clear and
useful tool to for communications in the 29th. It can be a powerful tool
for leadership to organize and run multiple squads in combat. If used
incorrectly it can also cause chaos and confusion. Following 29th rules
of decorum, and knowing teamspeak's capabilities will create greater
unit cohesion.

  - Never give anyone Teamspeak passwords. You may steam appropriate
    links: [29th.org/teamspeak](http://www.29th.org/vent) , but do not
    give passwords directly.
  - Do not "SPAM" coms, ever. This includes(but is not limited to)
    changing channels multiple times and voice commands.
  - Call superiors by rank and maintain 29th decorum and etiquette at
    all times.
  - If the word "break" is spoken, instantly go silent.
  - Only use the word "break" to silence the channel, or to give
    important information.
  - If a superior rank is speaking in game or in vent, instantly go
    silent, and stay that way until they are finished.
  - Remain silent while in line (during drills or scrim set up).
  - When entering a channel, wait for the first appropriate silence and
    announce your presence.
  - When entering a channel squad/platoon/office channel that is not
    your own: Ask for permission to stay, and only enter that channel if
    you have business there.
  - Do not enter channels that you have no business in.
  - 29th Room 1 is for general fraternizing and chat

<!-- end list -->

  - As with in game chat, keep in game chat to a minimum:
      - Discussing enemy positions, enemy movement, your movement,
        position, reloading...
      - Anything that would be helpful and not obvious to those on your
        team.
      - Imminent danger to team members or yourself in the only reason
        for "breaking in to team communications.
      - Do not become overly dependent on voice communication, Be
        prepared to use in game voice and text chat.
