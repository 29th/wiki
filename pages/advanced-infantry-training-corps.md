The Advanced Infantry Training Corps is a Staff Office within [S-3
Operations](S-3_Operations "wikilink") that is responsible for creating
and enforcing standardized practises of weapon usage throughout the
29th. The office consists of cadres for each AIT, who's primary
functions are:

  - Hosting training classes for their relevant AIT, and sending PMs to
    anyone holding that AIT, making them aware of the class.
  - Providing and ensuring good quality help for any who may have
    questions about their AIT.

## Attending Advanced Infantry Training Classes

A soldier will typically recieve a PM from the relevant AIT Cadre,
should a class be hosted, but if there is an interest to join a class
when a soldier is not in the AIT, the Cadre can be contacted by doing
the following:

  - Viewing the [Advanced Infantry Training Corps Staff
    List](http://29th.org/personnel/staff/?office=11) to PM the relevant
    person, or by [finding their Steam
    Profile](Find_a_Steam_Profile "wikilink")
