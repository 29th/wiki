In the 29th, we strive to be the best in what we do. We work hard to
play well, create a strong community, and have fun. In our goal to be
the best, we expect the highest levels of professionalism from our
members. We certainly don't feel that this expectation is unreasonable
or hard to reach, but time and time again we are reminded of the prowess
of fools. Particularly in TeamSpeak, there have been a number of
incidents that indicate a total lack of professionalism that require
Headquarters to take immediate action.

-----

**Moving forward, the following expectations are laid out and will be
enforced:**

1.  You are expected to address ranking members by their rank at all
    times. This isn't actually a new rule, but people tend to
    conveniently forget this one. Familiarity does not warrant you
    ignoring the rank of another member, especially in front of other
    members.
2.  In addition, all members should be acting their rank at all times.
    Obviously all of you are held to the same high professionalism
    standards, but holding a higher rank also means yet higher
    standards. If you expect to keep your rank, we expect you to behave
    like you deserve it.
3.  If you have the unique privilege of being able to create TeamSpeak
    channels, you will no longer abuse this power to create dumb
    temporary channels. If you want to create a quick "Office" so that
    you can have a meeting and people will know not to join, go for it.
    If you want to make a "Secret hideout" or "playing X game" channel,
    let me know so I can revoke your TS admin. There are 50+ TS channels
    where you can go to hang out, so use them.
4.  Any and all custom disconnect messages must be removed. I'm sorry if
    your message was just "see you later". Talk to the guy who had "6969
    fags" or just spammed random garbage if you want to express
    grievances.
5.  If you are going "away" for any reason, disconnect, hit the "Away"
    button, or move yourself to the "idle" channel at the bottom of the
    channel listing. Changing your name to include an away message like
    "Getting Coffee" or "Be Right Back" or whatever else you might be
    doing is strictly forbidden. It is no ones concern where you are
    when you are away and it looks completely unprofessional.
6.  If you will be expelling any bodily gas someone might find
    inappropriate during your time in TeamSpeak, keep it to yourself and
    keep your microphone turned off. Intentional misuse of bodily
    functions (including using your voice to be disruptive) will not be
    tolerated and will result in you being forced to use PTT at all
    times.
