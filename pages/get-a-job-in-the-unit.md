A lot of things happen in the 29th, and it requires a lot of work. This
work does not get done by just one person, or even a few. Many 29ers
have a [Staff Position](Staff_Positions "wikilink") in the unit, ranging
from clerical work to the Drill Instructors who taught you to be a 29er.
These jobs are open to you, too, and we encourage you to lend a hand and
get more involved in the unit. Needless to say, your involvement factors
in when promotion time comes.

To find job openings, browse to the [Battalion Support
Staff](http://forums.29th.org/categories/battalion-support-staff) forum:

In this forum, you will see a list of open positions. By clicking the
position, you will find its description and how to apply for it. To see
all the staff positions and who currently holds them, see
[Staff](http://personnel.29th.org/#units/Staff) from
[Personnel](http://personnel.29th.org/) page.

After applying, the head of that specific office may get back to you
about how to get started. If he doesn't, try applying for something
else. Getting a staff position in the unit is a great way to prove your
abilities both to the head of the office and to your Squad Leader.
